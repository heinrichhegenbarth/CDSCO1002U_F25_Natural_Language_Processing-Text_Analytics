Predsedajúci,NULL,SK,197770,,Ďalším bodom programu je vyhlásenie Rady a Komisie: Jednotná reakcia Európskej únie na neodôvodnené obchodné opatrenia USA a globálne obchodné príležitosti pre Európsku úniu (2025/2657(RSP)).,The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission: A united European Union response to unjustified US trade measures and global trade opportunities for the European Union (2025/2657(RSP)).
Adam | Szłapka,NULL,EN,0,President-in-Office of the Council,"in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, honourable Members, Commissioner, the EU-US trade and investment partnership is the most valuable in the world. I am convinced that we have a shared interest in protecting this mutually beneficial partnership and working together on common challenges. In this context, we deeply regret the recent increases of US tariffs applied on a very broad range of EU goods. We think that the imposition of additional tariffs, both universal and sectoral ones, is unjustified and arbitrary. These tariffs are damaging for prosperity. They negatively impact economic growth, foremost in the US but also globally, as confirmed by the IMF and WTO in their latest forecasts. Tariffs are taxes paid by businesses and ultimately by consumers. They will raise the cost of imports, disrupt supply chains and force companies to either absorb the cost or pass them on through higher prices, building up inflation. We welcome the 90-day suspension of a portion of the recently imposed US universal tariffs. At the same time, we are deeply concerned by many tariff increases remaining in place and possible new tariffs. More importantly, we are very concerned by the uncertainty that the US Administration announcements brought to the global economy. We understand that the US seeks to strengthen the resilience of its domestic industrial base and to enhance its economic security, but we believe that the announced tariffs are not the right way to achieve these goals. On behalf of the Council, I can assure you that we are united in our readiness to engage in a constructive dialogue with the US. Our priority is clearly to agree on a solution that is balanced and mutually beneficial, and that brings about more predictable trade and investment conditions. We believe that there is sufficient scope for delivering such a solution, but it is clear that significant joint efforts will still be needed to get there. We welcome recent concrete steps made by the Commission in the form of an offer of negotiations in selected areas. This step has full backing from the Council. As a clear sign of our good faith and our restraint, we have temporarily suspended the first set of countermeasures. It is also a sign of us not wishing to add to the already an unprecedented levels of economic uncertainty. But let me be clear: we will defend our legitimate interests and rights if we have to, and we will do so in a united, targeted and measured manner. There is a broad agreement in the Council on the need to work on possible further countermeasures, which would complement those already adopted. Our countermeasures can be fully reversed at any time if a negotiated solution is found. If, however, negotiation failed to deliver the desired outcome, we will consider taking further steps, keeping all options on the table, including a WTO complaint. We are working closely with the Commission. We are carefully assessing not only the effects of new US tariffs on EU exports, but also monitoring any unwanted indirect effects. We simply cannot absorb global overcapacity, we cannot accept dumping on our markets. Mr President, honourable Members, Commissioner, in these challenging times, we remain committed to the rules-based international order, as we continue to believe in an open and predictable global trading system that benefits all partners. We are engaging with our international partners both through multilateral fora as well as bilaterally. That is why the issue of possible trade diversion is firmly on our radar screen. In the Council, there is a broad agreement on the importance of deepening our existing partnerships around the world, as well as sealing new win-win deals. Finally, I want to underline that in times of growing uncertainty, the single market stands as a vital source of stability and resilience. The new situation we are facing gives an additional sense of urgency in implementing the new European competitiveness deal. We will therefore be stepping up our work in the Council towards lifting the remaining barriers to the proper functioning of our single market and boosting its potential.","in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, honourable Members, Commissioner, the EU-US trade and investment partnership is the most valuable in the world.

Maroš | Šefčovič,NULL,EN,0,Member of the Commission,"Mr President, honourable Members, dear Minister, dear Andre, first and foremost, I would like to appreciate that we have this very timely debate this morning, because it would allow us to have a deep look at the current state of our relationship between the European Union and the United States of America in the field of bilateral trade and economic cooperation. As was already highlighted by the Minister, we have built, together with the United States, over the years the largest bilateral and investment relationship in the world. Today, the European Union is by far the most important economic partner of the United States. Our trade in goods and services has doubled over the last decade, surpassing EUR 1.7 trillion in 2023, with EUR 851 billion of trade in goods and EUR 746 billion of trade in services. And for us, likewise, the US is our biggest trading partner. Our business communities have invested strongly on both sides. Total bilateral investment stocks reached EUR 5.3 trillion in 2022. Direct EU investment in the US is worth of EUR 2.7 trillion, making the EU companies the largest foreign investor in the United States of America. On top of it, I think it is very important to underline that European companies, EU firms directly employ 3.4 million people in the US, with millions more American workers, farmers and ranchers benefiting indirectly. Trade and investment between the European Union and the United States are therefore key building blocks of our shared prosperity, technology and research prowess, as well as remaining fundamental to our economic security. So it is evident that we have a mutual interest in nurturing and further developing our economic links and in making our partnership and relationship stronger. But as you know very well, honourable Members, our trade relations are currently facing strong headwinds. The US has unilaterally increased its import duties on EU goods in a significant manner. These import taxes are unjustified and cause economic harm on both sides of the Atlantic. They disrupt supply chains and affect global markets. They hurt EU and US companies, workers and farmers. They create uncertainty for transatlantic investment. They raise prices for consumers and businesses and increase inflation in the US. The US has temporarily decreased its universal additional tariffs from 20 % to 10 %. In response, we have shown significant goodwill by pausing our rebalancing measures on the steel and aluminium tariffs for 90 days. With this pause, we want to give space for negotiations. However, US tariffs still cover EUR 380 billion‑worth of EU exports to the US, corresponding to 70 % of our total exports, at rates between 10 % to 25 %. In addition, more US tariff actions could well be on their way, even though the US has acknowledged that the EU poses no problem and in fact shares many common challenges. On top of the ongoing investigation on lumber, the US has recently launched new Section 232 investigations based on national security grounds on: pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical ingredients; semiconductors, including semiconductor manufacturing equipment; critical minerals, also covering processed critical minerals and the derivative products; and, most recently, on tracks and track parts. This makes in total six additional ongoing investigations. If all these investigations lead to unjustified harmful tariffs, then another EUR 170 billion of EU exports to the US would be impacted. This means that in total around EUR 549 billion of EU exports to the US, meaning 97 % of the total would be subject to tariffs. In the terms of duties collected, this will be massive. In 2024, the US collected around EUR 7 billion in duties on EU exports. The projection is that the US might now collect as much as EUR 100 billion if the ongoing investigations result in tariffs. And, as you know, just yesterday we learnt about a new possible 100 % tariff on non‑US film production. So I believe that you would agree with me that the situation as such is not acceptable and we cannot afford to stay idle. And this brings me to our response. Honourable Members, we are not facing these headwinds on autopilot. As you know, President von der Leyen has entrusted me to engage with the US administration to try and find fair and mutually beneficial negotiated solutions and return to a constructive trade relationship. I am in constant contact with my US interlocutors for this purpose. In order to get these negotiations up and running, we have been scoping out the possibility to reduce barriers, not raise them, including by: proposing to agree on zero‑for‑zero tariffs for all industrial goods, including in strategic industrial sectors such as cars and car parts; jointly addressing global overcapacity in strategic industrial sectors such as steel and aluminium; jointly increasing the resilience of EU and US supply chains in sectors such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals; and securing a return to barrier‑free transatlantic trade and reviving our cooperation. So the EU has made clear that we are ready to discuss and we are ready to find mutually beneficial solutions respecting our interests and regulatory autonomy. We now need the US to show its readiness to make progress towards a fair and balanced solution. And I have already shared the approach with my US counterparts as a basis for further engagement. We are fully engaged in discussion with the US, as a negotiated solution remains our clear and preferred outcome. But if our talks with the US do not yield the necessary result, we will be ready for alternatives, with the aim of restoring a level playing field. Therefore, we are also using the 90‑day pause to continue our preparation for further rebalancing measures to counter the multitude of additional US tariffs on EU exports and ensure a level playing field in the longer term. And here I would like to underline that all options remain on the table. We are also preparing for litigation to preserve and reinforce the multilateral rules‑based trading system. At the same time, we are monitoring possible risks of trade diversion, by way of a Dedicated Import Surveillance Task Force, where the aim is to protect the EU market from possible surges of imports from other countries that are also hit by US tariffs and which seek alternative markets. The first results of this work are anticipated in mid‑May. The Commission stands ready, if necessary, to use all available tools in our trade defence instrument toolbox in a rapid manner to protect the EU single market, EU producers and EU consumers. We will also, honourable Members, continue diversifying our trade and investment ties with partners around the globe. This includes making the most of our extensive network of trade agreements with 76 countries across the globe, covering almost half of our trade, and doubling down on our efforts to finalise ongoing negotiations. Here, we know that countries around the world are looking at the EU as a trusted, reliable and predictable trading partner. In the current global environment, it is in everyone's interest to expand their network and strengthen their supply routes. For us, it is nothing less than a prerequisite for our competitiveness and our economic security that we find new markets for our exporters and new sources of imports, and it also helps double down on rules‑based trade, while we continue to push for proper multilateral governance with the WTO at its core. The US represents 13 % of global trade. It's a lot, but we must not forget about the remaining 87 %. And, therefore, work continues internally towards the adoption of signature of agreements with Mercosur and Mexico. These are perfect examples of deals we have made that can deliver hugely on our bid for diversification, to open new markets and further important geopolitical relations, while also securing key commitments on issues of climate change and sustainability. They offer significant opportunities for EU businesses and high potential for EU consumers. There is still work to be done to get them over the line. However, I count on the support of this House to ensure successful outcomes for the benefit of all. To conclude, Mr President, I also would like to inform the honourable Members that we are accelerating dramatically our ongoing negotiations with: India – we had very successful meetings just last week; Indonesia, where I had the important VTC yesterday; Philippines; Thailand; and Malaysia. As you know, we launched the free trade agreement talks with the United Arab Emirates, something which I believe could serve as a strong catalyst to advance our cooperation with the Gulf Cooperation Council countries with whom we are also negotiating strategic partnership agreements. So while we are pushing our FTA agenda forward, we are also making use of other, more flexible forms of engagement tailor‑made to our own needs and those of our respective partners, covering specific sectors and deepening our bilateral relations. Let me just conclude by highlighting that we are working very closely with Angola in implementing the Sustainable Investment Facilitation Agreement, which entered into force in 2024. And we are working closely with our partners on critical raw materials, but also on the digital trade agreements reached with South Africa earlier this year, and with Singapore, which I will be signing there on behalf of the EU this week. We are working very closely with South Africa also to advance our Clean Trade and Investment Partnership to strengthen our clean supply chains, which we hope to conclude by the end of 2025. My last, last point would be an appeal to all of us, and I would like to thank the Polish Presidency for excellent cooperation on making sure that our unity is unshakeable, that we act as one if it comes to these very important trade negotiations, because this is as vital as ever. And I would say that this is the time to act in unequivocal terms for the EU's interest and towards our goal of maintaining a strong and competitive economy as well as cohesive society.","Mr President, honourable Members, dear Minister, dear Andre, first and foremost, I would like to appreciate that we have this very timely debate this morning, because it would allow us to have a deep look at the current state of our relationship between the European Union and the United States of America in the field of bilateral trade and economic cooperation.

Jörgen | Warborn,PPE,EN,197405,On behalf of the Group,"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, colleagues, we find ourselves at a historic crossroads, not just in terms of economic policy, but also in the broader context of global geopolitics. Trade tension, of course, is nothing new. But today, in an era of deep globalisation and tightly interlinked supply chains, the consequences are more far-reaching than ever. We have seen this clearly in the past months, when Trump's erratic trade measures triggered volatility across financial markets. The EU's response, especially in the face of the unjustified trade measures from a long-standing ally, will be remembered. Our approach must strike a careful balance, preserving the principle of trust, respect and transatlantic cooperation, while also shielding European citizens and industries from economic harm. I therefore call on the Commission to act decisively within their 90-day retaliatory pause. The current pause from the Trump administration is de facto a 25 % tariff on EU steel, aluminium and automobiles and a 10 % tariff on almost all other goods. The Commission's decision to hold off on immediate retaliation is wise; de-escalation creates a space for dialogue. But let us be clear: inaction cannot become our policy. Within these 90 days, we must prepare a strong and measured and unified response. At the same time, we must do three things to strategically position Europe: strengthen the single market, negotiate and ratify more free trade agreements, not least Mercosur and the one with Mexico, and reassert leadership within WTO, because we need the rules-based international system when there is unpredictability in the world.","Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, colleagues, we find ourselves at a historic crossroads, not just in terms of economic policy, but also in the broader context of global geopolitics.

Iratxe | García Pérez,S-D,ES,28298,On behalf of the Group,"Señor presidente, querido comisario Šefčovič, Donald Trump y su visión del mundo son una amenaza directa no solo para el comercio internacional, sino también para los valores que sustentan nuestras democracias. Su guerra comercial contra la Unión Europea, con aranceles injustificados, amenazas a nuestras industrias y chantajes permanentes, es la manifestación más evidente de un nacionalismo económico autoritario que desprecia el derecho internacional y la cooperación entre iguales. Trump y sus socios de extrema derecha —dentro y fuera de la Unión Europea— no creen en un mundo ordenado por normas, sino en la ley del más fuerte. Frente a su embestida, no podemos ni debemos titubear. Estamos aquí para defender con firmeza el modelo europeo, un modelo basado en la justicia social, en el Estado del bienestar y en una economía que pone en el centro a las personas. La Unión Europea debe responder con contundencia. Nuestra respuesta debe desplegarse en varios frentes: la protección de nuestros trabajadores, consumidores y empresas; la defensa del orden internacional basado en reglas, con una Organización Mundial del Comercio fuerte y reformada; y la negociación frente a Trump desde una posición de firmeza, sin ceder a ningún tipo de chantaje. Tenemos las herramientas, pero debemos usarlas cuando sea necesario si esta amenaza continúa. Debemos adoptar sanciones y gravámenes a las grandes tecnológicas que incumplen nuestras normas y excluir a las empresas de los Estados Unidos de la contratación pública europea si continúan esta amenaza y este chantaje. Al mismo tiempo, debemos reforzar el mercado interior, impulsar la demanda interna y apoyar con un plan de ayudas directas a la industria y a las regiones más afectadas por esta guerra comercial. No olvidemos que el mundo es más grande que Trump. El 80 % de nuestras exportaciones se dirigen a otros mercados. Fortalezcamos los acuerdos con Canadá, Japón y México. Avancemos en Mercosur, India y con nuestros socios del África subsahariana. Diversificamos nuestra cadena de valor y hagamos de la Unión Europea una potencia líder a nivel mundial en comercio justo y sostenible. Pero hay una cuestión que es fundamental, y es que hay elementos que no son negociables: el Estado de Derecho no es negociable. La legislación europea no es negociable, porque somos un modelo único en el mundo. Eso nos ha hecho diferentes. Eso nos ha hecho fuertes. Y no podemos aceptar chantajes que vayan permitiendo que Europa cambie y modifique la legislación en aquello que tanto hemos avanzado: en el Estado del bienestar, en materia de igualdad, en materia también de cuestiones de sostenibilidad. La Unión Europea no puede ser rehén de cálculos electorales ni de tibiezas políticas. El reto al que nos enfrentamos es existencial. Se trata de decidir si queremos ser un actor global fuerte, soberano, con voz propia o si nos resignamos a ser meros espectadores sometidos a los caprichos de un demagogo multimillonario que desprecia todo lo que representa el proyecto europeo. Señorías, estamos ante un momento transformador. Este es el momento de levantar la voz, de defender con orgullo el proyecto europeo y de demostrar que, frente al caos, la Unión Europea es la esperanza de un orden justo, democrático y sostenible.","Mr. President, dear Commissioner Šefčovič, Donald Trump and his worldview are a direct threat not only to international trade, but also to the values that underpin our democracies. His trade war against the European Union, with unjustified tariffs, threats to our industries and permanent blackmail, is the most obvious manifestation of an authoritarian economic nationalism that disregards international law and cooperation among equals. Trump and his far-right partners - inside and outside the European Union - do not believe in a world ordered by rules, but in the law of the strongest. In the face of their onslaught, we cannot and must not falter. We are here to firmly defend the European model, a model based on social justice, the welfare state and an economy that puts people at the center. The European Union must respond forcefully. Our response must be deployed on several fronts: protecting our workers, consumers and businesses; defending the rules-based international order, with a strong and reformed World Trade Organization; and negotiating with Trump from a position of firmness, without giving in to any kind of blackmail. We have the tools, but we must use them when necessary if this threat continues. We must adopt sanctions and levies on the big tech companies that breach our rules and exclude U.S. companies from European public procurement if this threat and blackmail continue. At the same time, we must strengthen the internal market, boost domestic demand and support industry and the regions most affected by this trade war with a direct aid plan. Let us not forget that the world is bigger than Trump. Eighty percent of our exports go to other markets. Let us strengthen agreements with Canada, Japan and Mexico. Let's move forward in Mercosur, India and with our partners in sub-Saharan Africa. Let us diversify our value chain and make the European Union a world leader in fair and sustainable trade. But there is one issue that is fundamental, and that is that there are elements that are non-negotiable: the rule of law is non-negotiable. European legislation is non-negotiable, because we are a unique model in the world. That has made us different. That has made us strong. And we cannot accept blackmail that would allow Europe to change and modify the legislation on what we have advanced so much: on the welfare state, on equality, and also on sustainability issues. The European Union cannot be held hostage to electoral calculations or political lukewarmness. The challenge we face is existential. It is a question of deciding whether we want to be a strong, sovereign global player with our own voice or whether we resign ourselves to being mere spectators subject to the whims of a billionaire demagogue who despises everything the European project stands for. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a transformative moment. This is the time to raise our voices, to proudly defend the European project and to demonstrate that, in the face of chaos, the European Union is the hope for a just, democratic and sustainable order."
Jordan | Bardella,PfE,FR,131580,On behalf of the Group,"Monsieur le Président, Monsieur le Commissaire, rien n'a été anticipé, et pourtant l'Europe semble découvrir ce qui était annoncé depuis bien longtemps: conformément à son projet, Donald Trump utilise les droits de douane comme une arme pour faire plier aussi bien ses partenaires que ses concurrents. En frappant sans distinction presque tous les secteurs et tous les États, le président américain crée des incertitudes et des fragilités supplémentaires pour nos entrepreneurs. L'heure n'est cependant pas à la déploration; l'heure est à la riposte, à la réponse et à la défense de nos intérêts économiques. À court terme, il est dans notre bon droit de riposter par des droits de douane gradués, qui seront un moyen de pression pour négocier et obtenir un retour à la normale. L'Europe est un marché de 450 millions de consommateurs et il serait incompréhensible qu'elle reste les bras ballants. La véritable riposte consiste en une rupture claire avec au moins trois décennies d'errance, une rupture avec les choix de la Commission européenne. Alors que nous sommes entrés dans l'ère des affrontements, l'Europe ne peut plus être la seule puissance à respecter des règles internationales de bienséance que plus personne n'applique. Face à la concurrence féroce des puissances, et notamment des puissances émergentes, dans l'adversité d'un monde plus dur et plus incertain, je vous en conjure, réveillez-vous! Réveillez-vous ou bien notre agriculture disparaîtra. Réveillez-vous, ou bien notre industrie automobile mettra la clé sous la porte, notre métallurgie subira une saignée plus terrible encore – je pense évidemment ici aux salariés d'ArcelorMittal, condamnés par une inaction coupable et par des règles absurdes. Réveillez-vous en bâtissant l'autonomie stratégique des nations et du continent, avec l'objectif de dépendre le moins possible de l'extérieur pour nos besoins vitaux, à commencer par celui de notre défense. Toutes les règles contraignantes du pacte vert inspirées par l'écologie punitive doivent être levées pour permettre à nos entreprises et à nos agriculteurs, notamment, de produire sans entraves. Les règles du marché européen de l'électricité doivent être réformées et le nucléaire doit prendre toute sa place dans notre bouquet énergétique. Une véritable préférence nationale et européenne dans les commandes publiques doit s'appliquer, notamment en matière de défense, mais pas uniquement. Réveillez-vous! Réveillez-vous et sortez de la naïveté, ou bien l'Europe et toutes les nations qui la composent sortiront de l'histoire.","Mr. President, Commissioner, nothing has been anticipated, and yet Europe seems to be discovering what was announced a long time ago: in line with his plans, Donald Trump is using tariffs as a weapon to bend his partners and competitors alike. By striking indiscriminately at almost all sectors and all states, the American president is creating additional uncertainties and fragilities for our entrepreneurs. But this is no time for lament; it's time to fight back, to respond and to defend our economic interests. In the short term, we have every right to retaliate with graduated tariffs, as a means of pressure to negotiate a return to normality. Europe is a market of 450 million consumers, and it would be incomprehensible for it to stand idly by. The real response is a clear break with at least three decades of wandering, a break with the choices made by the European Commission. At a time when we have entered an era of confrontation, Europe can no longer be the only power to respect international rules of propriety that nobody applies any more. Faced with fierce competition from other powers, particularly emerging powers, in the adversity of a tougher and more uncertain world, I implore you to wake up! Wake up, or our agriculture will disappear. Wake up, or our automotive industry will close down, our metallurgy will suffer an even more terrible loss - I'm obviously thinking here of the employees of ArcelorMittal, condemned by culpable inaction and absurd rules. Wake up and build the strategic autonomy of nations and the continent, with the aim of depending as little as possible on the outside world for our vital needs, starting with our own defense. All the restrictive rules of the green pact, inspired by punitive ecology, must be lifted to allow our companies and farmers, in particular, to produce without hindrance. The rules of the European electricity market must be reformed, and nuclear power must take its rightful place in our energy mix. Genuine national and European preference in public procurement must be applied, particularly in defense, but not only. Wake up! Wake up and get over your naiveté, or Europe and all its constituent nations will go down in history."
Nicola | Procaccini,ECR,IT,197820,On behalf of the Group,"Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, noi conservatori crediamo nel libero mercato che favorisce allo stesso tempo i consumatori e i produttori, quelli naturalmente più capaci, con più talento. Ma dobbiamo ammettere che la politica dei dazi è stata anche una politica europea, che non si è rivolta soltanto verso chi viola ogni giorno la libera concorrenza, come la Cina, ma anche nei confronti di alleati preziosi come i cittadini americani. Faccio un solo esempio: fino a poche settimane fa gli Stati Uniti ponevano un dazio del 2,5 % sulle auto europee. L'Unione europea poneva un dazio del 10 % sulle auto americane. Da qui bisogna partire per un accordo con gli Stati Uniti di libero scambio con zero dazi da ambo le parti. È ciò di cui ha discusso Meloni con Trump a Washington dentro un quadro politico generale in cui va preservata l'unità dell'Occidente. Il riequilibrio della bilancia commerciale con gli Stati Uniti non è solo un fatto economico, è anche politico. Lo scandalo del gas liquido dalla Russia è emblematico di una certa ipocrisia europea e soltanto oggi il commissario Jørgensen sembra intenzionato ad occuparsene. Sapete quali sono le nazioni che hanno più arricchito Putin negli ultimi anni con l'acquisto di GNL? Beh, non è l'Ungheria di Orban ma è la Francia di Macron, con un incremento dell'81 % tra il 2024 e il 2023. Ed è la Spagna green di Sánchez che con il 38 % ha nella Russia il suo maggiore fornitore di gas. Ecco un'altra cosa giusta da fare: rimuovere i dazi che l'Unione europea ha inflitto a se stessa con il Green Deal e così rilanciare la sua competitività. Questa è la strada che dobbiamo percorrere; non certo quella che va verso regimi illiberali come la Cina o la Corea del Nord.","Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, we conservatives believe in the free market, which favors at the same time consumers and producers, those who are naturally more capable, more talented. But we must admit that the policy of tariffs has also been a European policy, which has not only been aimed at those who violate free competition every day, such as China, but also at valuable allies such as American citizens. I give just one example: until a few weeks ago, the United States was placing a 2.5 percent duty on European cars. The European Union was placing a 10 percent duty on American cars. This is where we need to start for a free trade agreement with the United States with zero tariffs on both sides. This is what Meloni discussed with Trump in Washington within an overall political framework in which the unity of the West must be preserved. Rebalancing the trade balance with the United States is not only an economic matter, it is also political. The liquid gas scandal from Russia is emblematic of a certain European hypocrisy, and only today Commissioner Jørgensen seems willing to deal with it. Do you know which nations have enriched Putin the most in recent years by buying LNG? Well, it is not Orban's Hungary, but it is Macron's France, with an 81 percent increase between 2024 and 2023. And it is Sánchez's green Spain, which with 38 percent has Russia as its largest gas supplier. Here is another right thing to do: remove the tariffs that the European Union has inflicted on itself with the Green Deal and thus boost its competitiveness. This is the path we must take; certainly not the one that goes to illiberal regimes like China or North Korea."
Valérie | Hayer,Renew,FR,135511,On behalf of the Group,"Monsieur le Président, Monsieur le Vice-Président, Monsieur le Ministre, chers collègues, «le vieux monde se meurt, le nouveau tarde à apparaître et dans ce clair-obscur surgissent les monstres»: cette citation d'Antonio Gramsci est la parfaite métaphore du défi posé par la guerre commerciale de Donald Trump. Cette guerre commerciale interroge l'identité même de l'Union européenne. Elle est, au-delà du péril immense qu'elle représente pour nos économies, un défi politique, une confrontation entre deux modèles, le modèle promu par cette nouvelle administration américaine – protectionnisme, brutalité, populisme – et notre modèle européen – liberté, force du droit, démocratie. Le «Make America great again» est une attaque frontale contre le multilatéralisme. C'est une attaque frontale contre une Europe dans laquelle 27 pays jouent le jeu de la coopération. C'est une attaque frontale contre ce que nous avons construit ensemble au lendemain de la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Oui, chers collègues, le commerce mondial régulé est un outil de paix durable, le plus puissant que nous ayons jamais connu. Pourtant, Donald Trump a décidé de lancer une guerre commerciale à la terre entière; à la terre entière, hormis la Russie, la Biélorussie et la Corée du Nord. Alors, je voudrais dire trois choses au président américain: premièrement, la guerre commerciale ne profite à personne et en aucun cas aux consommateurs américains qui sont les premiers à en payer le prix. Deuxièmement, l'Europe sera toujours un partenaire commercial juste et fiable, dans le respect des règles internationales. Troisièmement, s'il faut jouer le rapport de force, alors nous y sommes prêts. Vous l'avez rappelé, Monsieur le Vice-Président, nous avons tous les outils de défense commerciale pour protéger nos concitoyens et nos entreprises. C'est notre position. Sans jamais fermer la porte à la négociation, la Commission européenne doit être prête à se saisir de ces instruments. Chers collègues, la bataille culturelle imposée par Donald Trump oblige chacun à se positionner, y compris dans cet hémicycle. Certains d'entre vous étaient à Washington le soir même de son élection. Beaucoup ont appelé à un trumpisme, à la française ou à l'européenne. Certains, d'ailleurs, sont bien embarrassés aujourd'hui, comme c'est le cas des orateurs qui m'ont précédée. Ce sont les mêmes qui rêvent d'un repli sur les frontières nationales et d'un retour au protectionnisme économique. Je veux vous dire: ouvrez les yeux, cela ne marche pas! Voyez par vous-mêmes que cela ne peut pas marcher. Ce que nous défendons ici, c'est un commerce mondial régulé. Ce sont des accords de commerce conclus sur des bases de réciprocité qui ne mettent pas en péril nos agriculteurs ou nos industries, des accords de commerce qui permettent au contraire de diversifier nos approvisionnements en matières premières ou nos débouchés économiques. C'est la garantie de notre prospérité pour les années qui viennent. Dans cette période, chers collègues, l'Europe est tout sauf faible. Nous avons un marché de 450 millions d'Européens, attractif pour de nombreux pays qui veulent renforcer leurs relations avec nous. Nous avons un cadre législatif et réglementaire qui offre une visibilité rassurante pour de nombreux investisseurs. Alors ne laissons pas les monstres surgir du clair-obscur. Ne laissons pas l'Europe dévier de son chemin. Construisons les bases d'un monde nouveau où l'Union européenne répond au défi de sa souveraineté.","Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice-Chairman, Mr. Minister, ladies and gentlemen, ""the old world is dying, the new is slow in appearing, and in this chiaroscuro monsters arise"": this quotation from Antonio Gramsci is the perfect metaphor for the challenge posed by Donald Trump's trade war. This trade war calls into question the very identity of the European Union. Beyond the immense peril it represents for our economies, it is a political challenge, a confrontation between two models, the model promoted by this new American administration - protectionism, brutality, populism - and our European model - freedom, the rule of law, democracy. Make America great again"" is a frontal attack on multilateralism. It is a frontal attack on a Europe in which 27 countries play the game of cooperation. It is a frontal attack on what we built together in the aftermath of the Second World War. Yes, dear colleagues, regulated world trade is a tool for lasting peace, the most powerful we have ever known. Yet Donald Trump has decided to launch a trade war against the whole world; the whole world, apart from Russia, Belarus and North Korea. So I'd like to say three things to the American president: firstly, the trade war benefits nobody, and certainly not American consumers, who are the first to pay the price. Secondly, Europe will always be a fair and reliable trading partner, in compliance with international rules. Thirdly, if we have to use our strength, then we're ready to do so. As you pointed out, Mr. Vice-President, we have all the trade defense tools we need to protect our fellow citizens and our businesses. That's our position. Without ever closing the door to negotiation, the European Commission must be ready to seize these instruments. Ladies and gentlemen, the cultural battle imposed by Donald Trump is forcing everyone to take a stand, including in this Chamber. Some of you were in Washington on the very evening of his election. Many of you called for Trumpism, French-style or European-style. Some, moreover, are quite embarrassed today, as are the speakers who preceded me. These are the same people who dream of a retreat to national borders and a return to economic protectionism. I want to say to you: open your eyes, it doesn't work! See for yourselves that it can't work. What we're defending here is regulated world trade. These are trade agreements concluded on the basis of reciprocity that do not jeopardize our farmers or our industries, trade agreements that, on the contrary, enable us to diversify our supplies of raw materials or our economic outlets. This is the guarantee of our prosperity in the years to come. In these times, dear colleagues, Europe is anything but weak. We have a market of 450 million Europeans, attractive to many countries that want to strengthen their relations with us. We have a legislative and regulatory framework that offers reassuring visibility for many investors. So let's not let monsters emerge from the shadows. Let's not let Europe go off course. Let's build the foundations of a new world in which the European Union meets the challenge of its sovereignty."
Bas | Eickhout,Verts/ALE,EN,96725,On behalf of the Group,"Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, let's be very clear. The illegal tariffs that are imposed and announced by the Trump administration will not only hurt Europeans, they will also hurt US consumers and businesses. Trump is playing a stupid but dangerous game. If the current negotiations do not work – and the Commissioner already said it – the EU has to show its strength and retaliate firmly. We have the instruments to do so. It comes down to political will and leadership. We should not back down to a bully. Important in our reaction is solidarity amongst EU Member States, because it's key. We will have to stay united, and therefore the money raised by countermeasures should be invested to support the affected sectors in all countries, in order to keep the unity.

Martin | Schirdewan,The Left,DE,190517,On behalf of the Group,"Herr Präsident! Donald Trump hat es geschafft, in den ersten hundert Tagen seiner Präsidentschaft die internationalen Handelsbeziehungen komplett zu chaotisieren. Die Folgen für Wirtschaft und die Bevölkerung sind bereits absehbar. Die Wirtschaftsleistung wird zurückgehen, und gleichzeitig werden sich die Preise verteuern. Die Zeche dafür werden zuallererst wieder die arbeitende Bevölkerung zahlen und diejenigen, die sowieso wenig Geld in der Tasche haben. Diese Politik ist kein Zufall. Der Rechtspopulist Donald Trump versucht gezielt, die Interessen seiner Wirtschaftskumpels, nämlich der US‑Rüstungsindustrie, der US‑Energieriesen und der US‑Big‑Tech‑Unternehmen durchzusetzen. Aber die Europäische Kommission scheint das noch gar nicht wirklich begriffen zu haben. Herr Kommissar, wir befinden uns in einem globalen Handelskrieg, und dabei wird Handelspolitik als eine Waffe eingesetzt, um wirtschaftliche Interessen durchzusetzen und international Einflusssphären abzustecken. Dem muss europäische Politik mit einer klaren Strategie begegnen, die Wirtschaft und Jobs hier in der Europäischen Union schützt, und das geht nur mit massiven Investitionen in unsere Industrie. Das geht nur mit strategischer Unabhängigkeit der Europäischen Union. Heute wissen auch Sie, Herr Kommissar, dass die anfängliche Kopf‑in‑den‑Sand‑Strategie der Kommission à la „Es wird schon nicht so schlimm werden” politische Realitätsverweigerung war. Jetzt wollen Sie verhandeln, einen Deal auch im Sinne von Donald Trump abschließen, und wenn das nicht klappen sollte, dann soll es angeblich harte Gegenmaßnahmen geben. Von Angeboten Ihrerseits höre ich viel, die gibt es reichlich. Jetzt soll sogar noch mehr US‑Fracking-Gas gekauft werden – anstatt die europäische Energieunabhängigkeit voranzutreiben und so viele Jobs zu schaffen, wird eine neue Abhängigkeit von fossilen Energieträgern geschaffen. Das ist ökonomisch, sozial und ökologisch grundfalsch. Aber von dem Druck auf die US‑Regierung ist noch nichts zu sehen. Wo bleibt denn die Einführung des Instruments gegen Zwangsmaßnahmen? Wo bleibt denn die harte Regulierung der großen Big‑Tech‑Unternehmen? Wo bleibt die Einführung einer europäischen Digitalsteuer? Da machen Sie die Augen zu, da legen Sie die Hände hinter dem Rücken zusammen. Wollen Sie denn auf diese Art und Weise den reichsten Unternehmen und Menschen wie Elon Musk noch mehr Geld und vor allem auch unsere privaten Daten in den Rachen werfen? Es ist jetzt an der Zeit, mit Partnern wie Kanada, Mexiko, Japan, Südkorea, aber auch mit China an einer Handelsordnung zu wirken, die regelbasiert ist, auf fairem Handel statt auf entfesseltem Freihandel basiert. Und alles, was der EU‑Kommission da einzufallen scheint, sind Rohstoffabkommen wie das mit Ruanda, das maßgeblich zu einer Verschärfung des Krieges im Kongo beiträgt, oder digitale Kooperationsabkommen wie das mit Singapur, das unsere Datensicherheit unterläuft, oder aber klassische Freihandelsabkommen wie mit Mercosur, denen die Europäer schon seit TTIP die Rote Karte gezeigt haben, weil sie schlecht für soziale Standards, Umwelt und Landwirtschaft sind. Ihre Antwort auf Trump dient einzig und allein den US‑Oligarchen und den europäischen Oligarchen. Wir brauchen eine Antwort, die der Mehrheit der Bevölkerung und der Demokratie dient.","Mr President, Donald Trump has managed to completely chaotize international trade relations in the first hundred days of his presidency. The consequences for the economy and the population are already foreseeable. Economic output will fall and prices will rise at the same time. The bill for this will be paid first and foremost by the working population and those who already have little money in their pockets. This policy is no coincidence. The right-wing populist Donald Trump is deliberately trying to push through the interests of his economic cronies, namely the US arms industry, US energy giants and US big tech companies. But the European Commission doesn't really seem to have grasped this yet. Commissioner, we are in a global trade war, and trade policy is being used as a weapon to assert economic interests and stake out spheres of influence internationally. European policy must counter this with a clear strategy that protects the economy and jobs here in the European Union, and that is only possible with massive investment in our industry. This can only be achieved if the European Union is strategically independent. Today, Commissioner, you also know that the Commission's initial head-in-the-sand strategy of ""it won't be so bad"" was a political denial of reality. Now you want to negotiate, conclude a deal in the spirit of Donald Trump, and if that doesn't work, there are supposed to be tough countermeasures. I hear a lot about offers on your part, there are plenty of them. Now even more US fracking gas is to be bought - instead of driving forward European energy independence and creating so many jobs, a new dependency on fossil fuels is being created. This is economically, socially and ecologically fundamentally wrong. But there is still no sign of any pressure on the US government. Where is the introduction of the instrument against coercive measures? Where is the tough regulation of the big tech companies? Where is the introduction of a European digital tax? You are closing your eyes and putting your hands behind your back. Do you want to throw even more money and, above all, our private data down the throats of the richest companies and people like Elon Musk in this way? It is now time to work with partners such as Canada, Mexico, Japan, South Korea and China on a trade order that is rules-based and based on fair trade instead of unbridled free trade. And all the EU Commission seems to be able to come up with are commodity agreements such as the one with Rwanda, which contributes significantly to an intensification of the war in the Congo, or digital cooperation agreements such as the one with Singapore, which undermines our data security, or classic free trade agreements such as the one with Mercosur, which Europeans have already shown the red card to since TTIP because they are bad for social standards, the environment and agriculture. Their response to Trump serves only the US oligarchs and the European oligarchs. We need a response that serves the majority of the population and democracy."
René | Aust,ESN,DE,256929,On behalf of the Group,"Fraktion. – Herr Präsident, meine sehr geehrten Damen und Herren! Wer nach außen abhängig ist, wird nach außen handlungsunfähig. Und genau das ist eingetreten – nicht zufällig, sondern weil die Altparteien unsere militärische Sicherheit über Jahrzehnte den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika überlassen haben. Das war bequem, aber es war auch naiv. Heute sehen wir das Ergebnis: Europa ist erpressbar geworden. Die Regierung unter Donald Trump versucht, Europa zum Kauf von immer mehr US‑Fracking‑Gas zu nötigen. Die Folge: noch höhere Energiepreise zulasten unserer Industrie, unserer Familien und unseres Wohlstandes. Und es rächt sich auch das überhebliche Gehabe, mit dem viele in der europäischen Politik über Jahre hinweg auf Donald Trump herabgesehen haben. Die öffentlichen Angriffe haben dazu geführt, dass heute weder in Brüssel noch in Berlin oder Paris vertrauensvolle Gesprächskanäle zur US‑Regierung bestehen. Ein Glück, dass es in Europa auch andere Stimmen gibt – Viktor Orbán, Georgia Meloni und viele patriotische Regierungen –, die den Kontakt gepflegt haben. Doch es geht nicht nur um Amerika. Auch Handelsalternativen wurden fahrlässig zerstört durch Besserwisserei gegenüber China, gegenüber Indien und weiten Teilen Afrikas. Statt Partnerschaft gab es Belehrungen über Demokratie, über Menschenrechte, über Klima. Und heute? Heute fehlen uns genau diese Partner als Alternativen, die wir bräuchten, um in Verhandlungen mit den USA Stärke zeigen zu können. Denn wer keine Alternativen hat, hat auch keine Verhandlungsmacht. Das europäische Establishment hat unseren Kontinent durch Arroganz isoliert. Doch wer im 21. Jahrhundert bestehen will, braucht Kooperation statt Konfrontation, Partnerschaften, nicht Feindbilder. Und noch etwas: Heute zeigt sich, wie wichtig der europäische Binnenmarkt ist. Zu diesem haben wir uns als AfD immer bekannt. Unser Motto lautet: Deutschland zuerst, aber nicht Deutschland allein. Europa muss in zentralen Handelsfragen mit einer Stimme sprechen. Aber das setzt auch eines voraus, nämlich: Das europäische Establishment muss die Spaltung nach innen beenden. Erkennen Sie das Wahlergebnis in Rumänien an! Hören Sie auf, sich aus Brüssel heraus in die inneren Angelegenheiten Ungarns einzumischen, und stoppen Sie die Verfolgung der AfD in Deutschland!","Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. Those who are dependent on the outside become incapable of acting on the outside. And that is exactly what has happened - not by chance, but because the old parties left our military security to the United States of America for decades. That was convenient, but it was also naive. Today we see the result: Europe has become vulnerable to blackmail. The government under Donald Trump is trying to force Europe to buy more and more US fracking gas. The result: even higher energy prices at the expense of our industry, our families and our prosperity. And the arrogant attitude with which many in European politics have looked down on Donald Trump over the years is also taking its revenge. The public attacks have meant that there are no trustworthy channels of communication with the US government today, neither in Brussels nor in Berlin or Paris. Fortunately, there are other voices in Europe - Viktor Orbán, Georgia Meloni and many patriotic governments - that have maintained contact. But it's not just about America. Trade alternatives have also been negligently destroyed by know-it-all attitudes towards China, India and large parts of Africa. Instead of partnership, there were lectures on democracy, human rights and the climate. And today? Today, we lack precisely these partners as alternatives that we need in order to show strength in negotiations with the USA. Because if you have no alternatives, you have no negotiating power. The European establishment has isolated our continent through arrogance. But if you want to survive in the 21st century, you need cooperation instead of confrontation, partnerships, not enemy stereotypes. And one more thing: today it is clear how important the European single market is. As the AfD, we have always been committed to this. Our motto is: Germany first, but not Germany alone. Europe must speak with one voice on key trade issues. But this also requires one thing: the European establishment must end the internal division. Recognize the election result in Romania! Stop interfering in Hungary's internal affairs from Brussels and stop the persecution of the AfD in Germany!"

Competimos con las manos atadas mientras China, Turquía y Marruecos golpean con los dos puños. Y ustedes, socialistas y populares, son los responsables. Le niegan agua a Almería o Murcia, pero financian obras hídricas en Marruecos. Ustedes expropian cientos de miles de olivos en España para poner placas solares, ustedes prohíben a la industria vender coches con motores de combustión en 2035. Ustedes montaron un negocio especulativo de derechos de emisión de CO2 que ahoga a nuestras industrias por razones climáticas y un mecanismo de ajuste en frontera que es una barrera no arancelaria. Ustedes se meten en los consejos de administración debajo de las mesas a mirar el sexo de los administradores. Ustedes solo piensan en subir impuestos para pagar la juerga de las élites y se han gastado nuestro dinero en renovables chinas. Y en España ya no tenemos luz. Para ustedes, el libre comercio es rendirse con China. Para ustedes, libre comercio son esos acuerdos con países que no cumplen los estándares que se exigen a los nuestros. Por supuesto que rechazamos cualquier arancel a nuestros productores, pero primero y por encima de todo, rechazamos su Agenda 2030, su Pacto Verde y su hipocresía de fanáticos climáticos.","Mr. President, this is not about tariffs or trade barriers. This is about who gets the chopping block of the European economy. It is not true that we live in an endangered international free trade regime. Tariffs, import quotas and regulatory barriers are the general rule. China raised tariffs on pork a few months ago and you didn't say a peep. It is Brussels that has been raising barriers and burdens against our producers for decades in the name of Pachamama. We compete with our hands tied while China, Turkey and Morocco strike with both fists. And you, socialists and popular, are responsible. You deny water to Almeria or Murcia, but you finance water works in Morocco. You expropriate hundreds of thousands of olive trees in Spain to put solar panels, you prohibit the industry to sell cars with combustion engines in 2035. You set up a speculative business of CO2 emission rights that stifles our industries for climate reasons and a border adjustment mechanism that is a non-tariff barrier. You go under the board of directors' tables to look at the sex of the administrators. You only think about raising taxes to pay for the revelry of the elites and you have spent our money on Chinese renewables. And in Spain we no longer have electricity. For you, free trade means giving in to China. For you, free trade is those agreements with countries that do not meet the standards required of ours. Of course we reject any tariffs on our producers, but first and foremost, we reject your Agenda 2030, your Green Pact and your hypocrisy of climate fanatics."
Adam | Bielan,ECR,EN,23788,,"Mr President, dear Commissioner, let me start by thanking Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni for making the strategic decision to visit Washington at a critical moment for our transatlantic relations. While others choose ambiguity, she acted – because leadership means showing up. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the Polish Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, who continues to block President Duda's initiative to hold a long overdue EU-US summit in Warsaw under the Polish Presidency in the Council. This is a missed opportunity, both symbolically and politically. Cancelling the summit sends the wrong signal to our most important ally, especially as global tensions rise and our need for unity grows. Yes, we may have disagreements with the US on trade subsidies and regulatory divergence, but the answer should not be retaliation. The answer should be pragmatic engagement. We need a common strategic European response that both protects our interests and strengthens our partnership.","Mr President, dear Commissioner, let me start by thanking Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni for making the strategic decision to visit Washington at a critical moment for our transatlantic relations.

Karin | Karlsbro,Renew,SV,197401,,"Herr talman! Hur botar man Trumpångest? Det bästa receptet är ett starkt EU. Ett Europa som står upp för allt det där som gör den här planeten lite bättre: demokrati, frihandel, vetenskap, upplysning, rättsstat, jämställdhet. Eller enkelt uttryckt: det som kallas liberalism. Sedan president Trump flyttade in i Vita huset har vi sett en amerikansk president som ägnat all sin kraft åt att sabotera relationerna med sina bästa vänner, som med en aggressiv kampanjdiplomati hotar både den globala världsordningen och enskilda länder, som startar handelskrig och som bedriver ett ekonomiskt experiment med våra plånböcker och våra pensioner genom att införa höga tullar. Vi är redo att slå tillbaka. När Trump sviker och Putin hotar Europa behöver vi hålla ihop. Ett starkare EU som försvarar Europas, Sveriges och Ukrainas intressen är det vi behöver. När USA till och med höjer tullarna mot Ukraina ska vi jobba för att få bort dem. När USA försöker härska genom att splittra EU ska vi stärka den inre marknaden och handla mer med varandra. I dag har EU flest handelsavtal i världen med totalt 74 länder. Fler är på gång. Hur många nya avtal har Donald Trump? Noll.","Mr. President, how do you cure Trump anxiety? The best recipe is a strong Europe, a Europe that stands up for all the things that make this planet a little better: democracy, free trade, science, enlightenment, rule of law, equality. Or simply put: what is called liberalism. Since President Trump moved into the White House, we have seen an American president who has devoted all his energy to sabotaging relations with his best friends, who threatens both the global order and individual countries with aggressive campaign diplomacy, who starts trade wars and who conducts an economic experiment with our wallets and pensions by imposing high tariffs. We are ready to fight back. When Trump fails and Putin threatens Europe, we need to stick together. A stronger EU defending the interests of Europe, Sweden and Ukraine is what we need. When the US even raises tariffs against Ukraine, we will work to get them removed. When the US tries to rule by dividing the EU, we should strengthen the single market and trade more with each other. Today, the EU has the most trade agreements in the world with 74 countries. More are on the way. How many new agreements does Donald Trump have? Zero."
Anna | Cavazzini,Verts/ALE,DE,86793,,"Herr Präsident, lieber Herr Kommissar, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen! Es macht mir große Sorgen, dass Trumps Zollkrieg Jobs vernichtet, der Wirtschaft schadet, die Preise steigen lässt, und das vor allem in den USA. Und es macht mir extrem große Sorgen, dass in den USA gerade ein rechtsnationaler powergrab stattfindet, der Stück für Stück Demokratie und Rechtsstaatlichkeit abschafft. Und es ist so wichtig, dass die EU in diesem Chaos geschlossen agiert. Als größter Markt der Welt haben wir eine riesige Macht, und die sollten wir nicht kleinreden. Lassen wir uns von der aktuellen Zollpause nicht blenden. Viele von Trumps Zöllen, die sind bereits in Kraft, und deswegen müssen wir jetzt gezielte Gegenmaßnahmen auf den Weg bringen, wenn er die aktuellen Zölle nicht zurücknimmt. Dazu gehört auch eine Besteuerung der großen Digitalkonzerne. Klar muss die Kommission gleichzeitig weiter versuchen, zu verhandeln. Aber auf keinen Fall dürfen wir unsere Standards senken und unsere europäischen Gesetze aufweichen. Das gilt für die Regulierung von Techgiganten genauso wie für die Landwirtschaftsimporte und für die Regeln zu Methan. Neue LNG-Importe – ich weiß nicht, ob das eine gute Idee ist. Der zu erwartenden massiven Umlenkung aus China müssen wir mit robusten Schutzmaßnahmen begegnen. Ja, wir müssen die Handelspartner diversifizieren. Aber für mich heißt das vor allen Dingen, den Binnenmarkt zu stärken, die Nachfrage hier zu stärken. Ich sage ganz klar: Trumps Zollpolitik kann nicht die Ausrede dafür sein, dass wir bei neuen Handelsabkommen unsere Standards über Bord werfen und der weiteren Auslagerung von Industrieproduktion Tür und Tor öffnen. Bei aller Kritik an Trump dürfen wir nicht vergessen, dass sich in den USA in beiden Lagern eine riesige Unzufriedenheit über die Globalisierung Bahn bricht. Und das darf in Europa nicht passieren.","Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very concerned that Trump's tariff war is destroying jobs and damaging the economy. I am very concerned that Trump's tariff war is destroying jobs, damaging the economy and causing prices to rise, especially in the USA. And I am extremely concerned that a right-wing nationalist power grab is currently taking place in the USA, which is gradually abolishing democracy and the rule of law. And it is so important that the EU acts as one in this chaos. As the largest market in the world, we have enormous power and we should not downplay it. Let's not be blinded by the current tariff pause. Many of Trump's tariffs are already in force, which is why we must now initiate targeted countermeasures if he does not withdraw the current tariffs. This also includes taxing the big digital companies. Of course, the Commission must continue to try to negotiate at the same time. But under no circumstances should we lower our standards and soften our European laws. This applies to the regulation of tech giants as well as to agricultural imports and the rules on methane. New LNG imports - I don't know if that's a good idea. We must counter the expected massive diversion from China with robust protective measures. Yes, we need to diversify our trading partners. But for me, this means above all strengthening the domestic market and boosting demand here. I say quite clearly: Trump's customs policy cannot be an excuse for us to throw our standards overboard in new trade agreements and open the door to further outsourcing of industrial production. Despite all the criticism of Trump, we must not forget that there is huge dissatisfaction with globalization in both camps in the USA. And that must not happen in Europe."

Deuxièmement, de céder au chantage – à son chantage – en achetant 50 milliards de produits américains supplémentaires, histoire qu'il nous vende la pelle avec laquelle nous creusons notre propre tombe. Troisièmement, d'accélérer la signature de nouveaux accords commerciaux, pour commencer avec les États-Unis, mais aussi avec le Mercosur, l'Inde, la Thaïlande, l'Australie, et j'en passe.

Firstly, to never raise our voices in the face of an American president who is multiplying his violations of international law. Secondly, to give in to blackmail - his blackmail - by buying 50 billion more American products, so that he will sell us the shovel with which we are digging our own grave. Thirdly, to speed up the signing of new trade agreements, starting with the United States, but also with Mercosur, India, Thailand, Australia, and so on. In short, we've just been slapped in the face and you're turning the other cheek. Translation: free trade is dead, long live free trade! Let's go ahead and make ourselves even more dependent on the rest of the world, as if we hadn't learned anything from this crisis. Above all, let's sacrifice a little more of the same: the workers, the workers in the industries you're throwing away, Commissioner.

Petr | Bystron,ESN,DE,256928,,"Herr Präsident, liebe Kolleginnen, liebe Kollegen! „Make America great again″ ist natürlich eine Kampfansage an die ganze Welt, an die EU, an Europa. Warum? Der amerikanische Präsident kümmert sich natürlich um die Amerikaner – oh Wunder! Er will Arbeitsplätze in den Vereinigten Staaten. Er will, dass Wohlstand wieder in den Vereinigten Staaten zurück ist. Er will die Industrie in die Vereinigten Staaten zurückholen. Und was höre ich hier? Trump, Trump, Trump! Ein einziger Mann reicht, um das Europäische Parlament in Aufruhr zu versetzen. Liebe Kollegen, anstatt zu jammern und über Trump herzuziehen, sollten Sie von den Altparteien lieber überlegen: Was haben Sie gemacht? Wann haben Sie das letzte Mal für Ihre Wähler so gekämpft wie Trump für seine amerikanischen? Die Frage ist berechtigt, denn Trumps Reaktion ist nur eine logische Entwicklung der letzten Jahrzehnte. Die Arbeitsplätze, nicht nur aus den USA, auch aus Europa, sind abgewandert in Billiglohnländer. Das haben unsere Menschen, unsere Arbeiter zu spüren bekommen, genauso wie die Amerikaner. Zuerst in der Stahlindustrie, dann in der Elektronikindustrie, in der Automobilindustrie, und jetzt zuletzt sind sogar unsere Bauern dran. Wie ist unsere Reaktion? Wollen wir in einen Handelskrieg eintreten? Wollen wir mit künstlicher Verteuerung der Importe reagieren? Natürlich nicht! Wir brauchen den freien Handel, wir wollen den freien Handel. Und Europa – und damit meine ich nicht die EU –, Europa kann diesen Wettbewerb aufnehmen. Wir haben die besser ausgebildeten Arbeitskräfte, wir haben eine innovative Industrie, wir haben Rohstoffe auf diesem Kontinent, wir können diesen Wettbewerb aufnehmen, aber wir müssen die Fesseln sprengen, die uns hier bremsen. Wir müssen den Green Deal beenden, Steuern runter, und wir müssen das Bürokratiemonster Brüssel zerschlagen. „Afuera“, das ist das Motto der Zeit, und dann kann unser Motto heißen: „Make Europe great again“.","Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. ""Make America great again"" is of course a declaration of war on the whole world, on the EU, on Europe. Why is that? The American President naturally cares about the Americans - oh wonder! He wants jobs in the United States. He wants prosperity back in the United States. He wants to bring industry back to the United States. And what do I hear here? Trump, Trump, Trump! One man is enough to send the European Parliament into an uproar. Dear colleagues, instead of moaning and complaining about Trump, you from the old parties should think about it: What have you done? When was the last time you fought for your voters like Trump did for his American voters? The question is justified, because Trump's reaction is just a logical development of the last few decades. Jobs, not just from the USA, but also from Europe, have migrated to low-wage countries. Our people, our workers, have felt the effects of this, just like the Americans. First in the steel industry, then in the electronics industry, in the automotive industry, and now it's even our farmers' turn. What is our reaction? Do we want to enter into a trade war? Do we want to react by making imports artificially more expensive? Of course not! We need free trade, we want free trade. And Europe - and I don't mean the EU - Europe can take on this competition. We have a better educated workforce, we have an innovative industry, we have raw materials on this continent, we can take on this competition, but we have to break the shackles that are holding us back here. We need to end the Green Deal, lower taxes and we need to smash the Brussels bureaucracy monster. ""Afuera"" is the motto of the time, and then our motto can be: ""Make Europe great again""."
Fabio | De Masi,NI,DE,124858,,"Herr Präsident, sehr geehrte Damen und Herren! US-Präsident Donald Trump versucht, uns mit Strafzöllen zu erpressen. Er will, dass wir mehr von seinem schmutzigen Fracking-Gas kaufen. Und er will den Abstieg der US-Industrie bremsen. Aber wir in Europa, wir sind nur bedingt ökonomisch verteidigungsfähig, denn wir haben zum Beispiel in Deutschland, der größten Volkswirtschaft Europas, seit drei Jahren Rezession. Wir haben uns mit den Sanktionen mehr selbst geschadet, als dass wir damit Putin getroffen hätten. Wir haben Verbrauchssteuern erhöht, die vor allem die Menschen mit kleinem Einkommen treffen. Und währenddessen besorgen sich die USA jetzt die Seltenen Erden aus der Ukraine, während wir als Zahlmeister am Spielfeldrand stehen. Auch die Transformation zum grünen Stahl, die kann nicht gelingen, wenn die Energiepreise weiter so hoch sind. Deswegen müssen wir zu dem Prinzip zurückkehren, zu sagen: Wir besorgen uns die Energie wieder vom billigsten Anbieter. Das wäre die richtige Antwort auf Donald Trump, um uns nicht weiter erpressbar zu machen. Und es würde ein diplomatisches Fenster in der Ukraine öffnen. Wir brauchen mehr öffentliche Investitionen. Es ist doch völlig verrückt, wenn in den Talkshows nun darüber diskutiert wird, wir sollten Panzer statt Volkswagen bauen. Und wir brauchen Strafsteuern auf Finanzflüsse der Big-Tech-Unternehmen, um unseren Mittelstand zu schützen.","Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen! US President Donald Trump is trying to blackmail us with punitive tariffs. He wants us to buy more of his dirty fracking gas. And he wants to slow down the decline of US industry. But we in Europe only have limited economic defenses, because in Germany, for example, Europe's largest economy, we have been in recession for three years. We have done more harm to ourselves with the sanctions than we have done to Putin. We have increased consumption taxes, which primarily affect people with low incomes. And in the meantime, the USA is now procuring rare earths from Ukraine, while we stand on the sidelines as paymasters. Even the transformation to green steel cannot succeed if energy prices remain so high. That's why we need to return to the principle of saying: we'll get our energy from the cheapest supplier again. That would be the right response to Donald Trump, so as not to make ourselves vulnerable to further blackmail. And it would open a diplomatic window in Ukraine. We need more public investment. It's completely crazy when the talk shows are now discussing whether we should build tanks instead of Volkswagens. And we need punitive taxes on the financial flows of big tech companies to protect our SMEs."
Lukas | Sieper,NI,DE,256971,,"Vielen Dank, Herr Kollege, dass Sie die blaue Karte akzeptiert haben. Sie haben gesagt: Wir sollen uns die Energie wieder vom billigsten Anbieter besorgen. Ich nehme mal an, Sie meinen damit die Russen. Trotz des russischen Angriffskriegs, trotz der russischen Kriegsverbrechen, trotz der Deportation von Hunderttausenden Kindern. Ohne jetzt auf diese konkrete Frage einzugehen, würde ich deswegen mal gerne so Ihr generelles moralisches Verständnis abstecken. Was darf denn ein Energieanbieter tun, damit wir uns die Energie nicht mehr von ihm besorgen, nur weil es dann billiger ist?","Thank you very much for accepting the blue card, Mr. Schroeder. You said that we should get our energy from the cheapest supplier again. I assume you mean the Russians. Despite the Russian war of aggression, despite the Russian war crimes, despite the deportation of hundreds of thousands of children. Without going into this specific question now, I would therefore like to get your general moral understanding. What is an energy supplier allowed to do so that we no longer buy energy from them just because it is cheaper?"
Fabio | De Masi,NI,DE,124858,,"Nun, die Frage der Moral, die richtet sich danach, welches Instrument geeignet ist, den Ukrainekrieg so schnell wie möglich zu beenden. Und wenn wir uns ökonomisch mehr schaden, als dass wir die Fähigkeit Putins, einen Krieg zu führen, beeinträchtigen, dann ist das einfach keine sinnvolle Politik. Wir haben selbstverständlich nach dem Irakkrieg nicht angefangen, die USA zu sanktionieren, weil wir uns damit selbst ins Knie geschossen hätten. Deswegen ist das keine moralische Frage, sondern eine Frage der politischen Logik, dass wir eine Politik machen, die den Menschen in Europa dient. Und wenn sie eben nicht zum gewünschten Ergebnis führt, dann kann ja eine Entspannung der Sanktionen auch ein Instrument sein, um zu einem Waffenstillstand zu gelangen. Deswegen sind jene unmoralisch, die diesen Krieg unnötig verlängern wollen und immer mehr Blut und Leichenberge in Kauf nehmen.","Well, the question of morality depends on which instrument is suitable for ending the war in Ukraine as quickly as possible. And if we harm ourselves economically more than we impair Putin's ability to wage war, then that is simply not a sensible policy. Of course, we didn't start sanctioning the USA after the Iraq war because we would have shot ourselves in the foot. That is why it is not a moral question, but a question of political logic that we pursue a policy that serves the people of Europe. And if it does not lead to the desired result, then relaxing the sanctions can also be an instrument for achieving a ceasefire. That is why those who want to prolong this war unnecessarily and accept more and more blood and piles of corpses are immoral."

Juan Ignacio | Zoido Álvarez,PPE,ES,197621,,"Señor presidente, señorías, que los aranceles nos conducen al desastre no es ninguna sorpresa. Lo dice la teoría económica más básica, lo dice la historia del comercio internacional y ahora lo vuelven a confirmar los datos. El precio de los productos afectados ha aumentado cerca de un 12 % para los consumidores. De continuar este encarecimiento, provocará una pérdida de 7 300 millones de dólares anuales, algo que ya está notándose en el empleo con la destrucción de 40 000 puestos de trabajo al otro lado del Atlántico. Por tanto, el fracaso de los aranceles es ya manifiesto. De ahí que la suspensión haya sido por fin una medida racional por parte del señor Trump, necesaria tanto para estadounidenses como para europeos. Pero no podemos conformarnos con ella: necesitamos su eliminación definitiva, incluida la tasa del 10 %, que todavía sigue en vigor. No podemos permitir que la amenaza arancelaria penda sobre nuestras cabezas como una espada de Damocles. No podemos seguir poniendo en riesgo la seguridad jurídica de cientos de miles de productores europeos.","Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, it is no surprise that tariffs are leading us to disaster. The most basic economic theory says so, the history of international trade says so, and now the data confirms it again. The price of the products affected has increased by nearly 12% for consumers. If this price increase continues, it will cause a loss of 7.3 billion dollars a year, something that is already being felt in employment with the destruction of 40,000 jobs on the other side of the Atlantic. The failure of the tariffs is therefore obvious. Hence the suspension was finally a rational measure on the part of Mr. Trump, necessary for both Americans and Europeans. But we cannot be satisfied with it: we need its definitive elimination, including the 10% tariff, which is still in force. We cannot allow the tariff threat to hang over our heads like a sword of Damocles. We cannot continue to jeopardize the legal security of hundreds of thousands of European producers."

Stajemy dziś w obliczu kolejnej próby dla Unii Europejskiej, czyli odpowiedzi na jednostronne decyzje w polityce handlowej Stanów Zjednoczonych, które uderzają w interesy europejskich przedsiębiorstw. Współpraca transatlantycka jest dla nas ważna, ale musi być oparta na partnerstwie, a nie uległości. Przez lata Europa straciła swoją konkurencyjność. Gospodarka Unii rozwija się znacznie wolniej niż gospodarka amerykańska czy azjatycka. Unijne regulacje dławią innowacje. Polityka klimatyczna zwiększa koszty produkcji, a biurokracja zniechęca inwestorów. W takich warunkach nie możemy mówić o suwerenności gospodarczej. Odpowiedzią nie może być więcej regulacji ani kolejne zielone transformacje, które przynoszą wyższe rachunki, a nie realne miejsca pracy. Musimy odbudować europejski przemysł, chronić nasz rynek i żądać równych zasad gry w relacjach z każdym partnerem, również ze Stanami Zjednoczonymi. Nie chodzi o konfrontację, ale o podmiotowość. Europa musi przestać być laboratorium ideologii, a zacząć być realną siłą gospodarczą. Żeby to zrobić, trzeba zerwać z polityką prowadzoną od lat przez lewicowo-liberalną większość. Polityka handlowa Unii nie może być prowadzona na niemieckie zamówienie. Dlatego umowa o wolnym handlu Unia Europejska – Mercosur nadaje się tylko do kosza, bo likwiduje bezpieczeństwo żywnościowe Europy. Trzeba zapobiec wojnie handlowej.

Today we are faced with another test for the European Union, that of responding to unilateral decisions in US trade policy that hit the interests of European businesses. Transatlantic cooperation is important to us, but it must be based on partnership, not submission. Over the years, Europe has lost its competitiveness. The EU economy is growing much slower than the US or Asian economies. EU regulations stifle innovation. Climate policy increases production costs, and bureaucracy discourages investors. Under such conditions, we cannot speak of economic sovereignty. The answer cannot be more regulations or more green transformations that bring higher bills, not real jobs. We must rebuild European industry, protect our market and demand a level playing field with every partner, including the United States. This is not about confrontation, but about subjectivity. Europe must stop being a laboratory of ideology and start being a real economic force. To do so, it needs to break with the policies pursued for years by the left-liberal majority. The Union's trade policy cannot be conducted on German orders. That's why the European Union-Mercosur free trade agreement is only fit for the trash, because it removes Europe's food security. A trade war must be prevented. We must repair relations with the United States, because it is still Europe's greatest ally and NATO partner."

For years we have abandoned and penalized strategic sectors: industry, automotive, agriculture, chemicals and steel. We have lost dynamism and become less competitive in world markets, with self-imposed limitations. Without a recovering competitive economy, we will not have strength on the negotiating tables.

Trade policy must finally become more pragmatic instead of being used as a substitute for a lacking EU foreign policy. We must conclude the trade agreement with India this year, ratify the agreement with Mexico, and above all: Every EU country that has not yet ratified the CETA agreement with Canada must finally do so. Above all, I can no longer understand this mythical but fact-free blockade of the Mercosur agreement.

Saskia | Bricmont,Verts/ALE,FR,197470,,"Monsieur le Président, l'arrivée de Trump vient nous rappeler une leçon que l'Europe aurait déjà dû tirer de la pandémie: notre ultradépendance aux énergies fossiles et aux marchés d'approvisionnement mondiaux finira par causer notre perte. L'Europe doit assurer son autonomie stratégique, répondre de manière ferme et unie à toute hausse des tarifs sans transiger sur ses législations et en utilisant les recettes de la hausse des tarifs, ainsi que celles d'une taxe digitale pour soutenir les travailleurs et les entreprises européennes qui sont touchés. Nous devons contrer les arrivées de marchandises destinées au marché américain, mais que l'imposition des tarifs aurait détournées, notamment vers l'Union européenne. Oui, nous devons renforcer nos partenariats avec les autres pays frappés par la guerre commerciale de Trump, mais des partenariats équitables qui ont pour point de départ et pour point d'arrivée les objectifs de développement durable. Il n'est pas question de transiger avec nos droits sociaux et environnementaux ni avec les droits humains. Il n'est donc pas question non plus de se précipiter dans des accords avec la Chine, l'Inde, le Mercosur, qui risqueraient de rendre l'Union européenne encore plus dépendante et vulnérable. Renforcer notre économie stratégique, c'est miser sans délai sur notre indépendance énergétique, notre autonomie alimentaire, l'économie circulaire, la réduction de notre dépendance aux ressources, notre redéploiement industriel, en un seul mot: la transition vers une vraie autonomie européenne.","Mr. President, Trump's arrival reminds us of a lesson that Europe should have already learned from the pandemic: our ultra-dependence on fossil fuels and global supply markets will ultimately be our undoing. Europe must ensure its strategic autonomy, responding firmly and unitedly to any tariff hikes without compromising on its legislation, and using the revenues from tariff hikes, as well as those from a digital tax, to support European workers and businesses who are affected. We must counter the influx of goods destined for the US market, but which the imposition of tariffs would have diverted, notably to the European Union. Yes, we must strengthen our partnerships with the other countries hit by Trump's trade war, but fair partnerships that have the Sustainable Development Goals as their starting point and end point. There is no question of compromising our social and environmental rights or human rights. Nor is there any question of rushing into agreements with China, India or Mercosur, which would risk making the European Union even more dependent and vulnerable. Strengthening our strategic economy means investing without delay in our energy independence, our food autonomy, the circular economy, the reduction of our dependence on resources, our industrial redeployment - in a word, the transition to true European autonomy."

Da qui dobbiamo mandare un messaggio chiaro: le nostre leggi le decidiamo in Europa per gli europei. Nei prossimi mesi negozieremo per superare questa situazione dannosa per l'economia di entrambe le sponde dell'Atlantico. Con la commissione Commercio saremo a Washington a fine mese. Vogliamo trovare un accordo utile: ma se non ci sarà davvero la volontà di arrivarci, saremo pronti a rispondere con contromisure forti su beni e servizi americani. In ogni caso, l'Europa deve stabilire un'alleanza con tutti coloro che vogliono mantenere un ordine del commercio mondiale fondato sulle regole e stipulare nuovi accordi.

From here we must send a clear message: we decide our laws in Europe for Europeans. In the coming months we will negotiate to overcome this harmful situation for the economy on both sides of the Atlantic. With the Trade Commission we will be in Washington at the end of the month. We want to find a useful agreement: but if there is really no will to get there, we will be ready to respond with strong countermeasures on American goods and services.

Súlyos stratégiai hiba volt, hogy a választások előtt a brüsszeli mainstream egyértelműen letette a voksát a demokrata jelölt mellett. A korrigálás túl későn érkezett. Le kellene végre szokni arról, hogy Brüsszelből próbálják megmondani, egyes országok polgárai milyen kormányra szavazzanak. A Bizottságtól azt várjuk el, hogy hatékony tárgyalással rendezze a kialakult helyzetet. Legyen nyitott az innovatív megoldásokra. Üzletemberrel üzletember módjára kell tárgyalni, közben rendet kell tenni a saját portánkon. Le kell végre építeni a bürokráciát, kevesebb és egyszerűbb szabály kell, véget kell vetni az előző öt év ideológiai, gazdasági és kereskedelmi politikájának, meg kell védeni a gazdákat, és vonzóbbá kell tenni a belső piacot.

Csak így nyerhetjük vissza a versenyképességünket, és lehetünk újra komoly szereplői a nemzetközi történéseknek.","Mr President! In these turbulent times, we need strategic calm, no rushing, no threats. We need to think about what is in Europe's interest. Certainly not a trade war! That would do our own citizens, our own companies and our own industry the most harm. Supply chains would be damaged, prices would rise, companies would be lost. It was a serious strategic error that the Brussels mainstream clearly voted for the Democratic candidate before the elections. The correction came too late. We should finally stop trying to tell people in Brussels which government to vote for in each country. We expect the Commission to resolve the situation through effective negotiation. Be open to innovative solutions. Negotiate with business like a businessman, while tidying up our own mess. We need to cut red tape at long last, we need fewer and simpler rules, we need to put an end to the ideological, economic and trade policy of the last five years, we need to protect farmers and we need to make the internal market more attractive. That is how Europe can remain open to all in the hope of mutual benefit. Only in this way can we regain our competitiveness and become a serious player on the international scene."
Jaak | Madison,ECR,ET,197493,,"Austatud president! Jah, suur aitäh, head armsad kolleegid! Ja kuidas peaks Euroopa Liit vastama USA tariifidele, mille nad kehtestasid? Ei, me ei peakski Trumpi karistama selle eest, vaid peaksime mõtlema, et kuidas arendada omaenda majandust. Euroopa Liidu praegune majandusruum on direktiivide ja regulatsioonide labürint. See lämmatab ettevõtlikkust, tõrjub investeeringuid ja pidurdab majanduskasvu. Euroopa oli kunagi vabaturumajanduse eestkõneleja, aga on liikumas sotsialistliku käsumajanduse suunas. Ettevõtjad kulutavad praegu rohkem aega regulatiivsete nõuete täitmisele kui toote arendustele. Paljud firmad loobuvad laienemisest, sest ei suuda kanda direktiividest tulenevaid kulusid. Investorid eelistavad oma raha paigutada riikidesse, kus riskid on väiksemad ja regulatsioonid mõistlikumad. Me ei tohi lubada, et bürokraatia asendab vaba ettevõtluse vaimu. Just vabadus on ajalooliselt viinud Euroopa suuremate innovatsioonideni, loonud töökohti ja jõukust. Euroopal on potentsiaal olla juhtiv jõud maailma majanduses, kui ta taastab usu turu vabadusse. See tähendab usaldust ettevõtjate vastu. See tähendab lihtsamaid ja paindlikumaid reegleid. See tähendab vähem direktiive ja rohkem otsustusvabadust. Muu hulgas tähendab see muidugi ka rohepöördele vee peale tõmbamist. Ainult nii kaitseme Euroopa majandushuve ja oma kodanike heaolu.","Dear President. Yes, thank you very much, dear colleagues! And how should the European Union respond to the US tariffs that they have imposed? No, we should not punish Trump for this, but we should think about how to develop our own economy. The European Union's current economic space is a labyrinth of directives and regulations. It stifles entrepreneurship, discourages investment and stifles growth. Europe used to be a champion of the free market economy, but it is moving towards a socialist command economy. Businesses now spend more time on regulatory compliance than on product development. Many companies are abandoning expansion because they cannot bear the costs of directives. Investors prefer to put their money in countries where the risks are lower and the regulations more reasonable. We must not allow red tape to replace the spirit of free enterprise. It is freedom that has historically led Europe to greater innovation, jobs and prosperity. Europe has the potential to be a leading force in the global economy if it restores faith in market freedom. That means trust in entrepreneurs. It means simpler and more flexible rules. It means fewer directives and more freedom of choice. Among other things, of course, it also means putting the green revolution on the back burner. This is the only way to protect Europe's economic interests and the well-being of its citizens."

Les droits de douane sont devenus des armes économiques. La mondialisation, souvent source indéniable de richesse, est en pleine mutation. La richesse ne ruisselle plus forcément jusqu'aux plus faibles. Le dumping environnemental devient un atout de compétitivité majeur et certains dirigeants politiques ne sont plus fiables. Face à cette dérive, nous devons repenser nos accords commerciaux pour les rendre plus équilibrés, en protégeant nos intérêts vitaux et nos valeurs, et en assurant notre autonomie stratégique.

Tariffs have become economic weapons. Globalization, often an undeniable source of wealth, is in a state of flux. Wealth no longer necessarily trickles down to the weakest. Environmental dumping is becoming a major competitive advantage, and some political leaders are no longer reliable. Faced with this drift, we need to rethink our trade agreements to make them more balanced, while protecting our vital interests and values, and ensuring our strategic autonomy. International trade cannot be reduced to quotas, volumes and prices. It must regain meaning, based on the theory of comparative advantage.

Pasquale | Tridico,The Left,IT,257133,,"Signor Presidente, signor Commissario, onorevoli colleghi, la politica commerciale di Trump rispolvera la logica mercantilista secondo cui un disavanzo commerciale rappresenterebbe una minaccia. Nel 2023 gli Stati Uniti hanno importato dall'Unione europea beni per circa 157 miliardi di euro. Però dobbiamo allargare lo sguardo ai servizi e qui notiamo che sono gli Stati Uniti ad avere un surplus di 109 miliardi. Questo ci ricorda di quanto le relazioni economiche siano complesse e vadano lette nel loro insieme. Oggi i dazi sono sospesi ma le tensioni restano e intanto molte grandi aziende statunitensi, in particolare nel digitale, continuano a fare profitti esorbitanti. È una questione di giustizia: dobbiamo mettere riparo a questa situazione. Per questo serve una tassa sui servizi digitali. Inoltre l'Unione europea dovrebbe allargare i suoi legami commerciali con altri paesi emergenti, i BRICS, e non dipendere dalle scelte unilaterali di Trump. Non dimentichiamoci le ricadute economiche dei dazi, la recessione. Per questo dobbiamo puntare anche sulla crescita dei salari, sulla domanda interna e sui consumi.

Today the tariffs are suspended but tensions remain and meanwhile many large U.S. companies, particularly in digital, continue to make exorbitant profits. This is a matter of justice: we need to remedy this situation. That's why we need a tax on digital services. In addition, the European Union should expand its trade ties with other emerging countries, the BRICS, and not depend on Trump's unilateral choices.

You have also self-imposed duties when you have enacted short-sighted ideological policies such as the Green Deal, the stop to endothermic engines that are only leading Europe to productive desertification and unemployment, depriving families of their purchasing power.

Politikov, čo mu fandia, ale máme aj v Európe a aj na Slovensku na čele s predsedom vlády Róbertom Ficom. Naši občania pritom budú trpieť najviac: v automobilkách, oceliarniach, v subdodávkach. Vláda sa má za naše firmy biť aj za našich občanov, a to spolu s Úniou. Nestačí zamestnancov poslať na kurzarbeit. A nepomôže ani cesta premiéra do Moskvy tento týždeň. Je dobré, že v Kanade aj v Austrálii vyhrali politici, ktorí veria vo férový obchod a nie v šikanu. Máme otvárať trhy, máme zlepšovať podnikateľské prostredie, máme lákať firmy a talenty do Európy. Ale áno, treba aj rokovať a trpezlivo rokovať so Spojenými štátmi. Ale aj my chceme spravodlivosť v obchode. Obrovskí digitálni obri a giganty v Európe zarábajú miliardy eur. Je to fér? Ak sa nedohodneme so Spojenými štátmi, Komisia musí konať a my budeme jej partnermi.","Mr President, Mr Trump has told the American people that there will be fewer toys and they will be more expensive at Christmas. These are the great results of Donald Trump's tariffs policy. However, we also have politicians cheering him on in Europe and also in Slovakia, led by Prime Minister Róbert Fico. Our citizens will suffer the most: in the car factories, in the steel mills, in subcontracting. The government is supposed to fight for our companies and our citizens, together with the Union. It is not enough to send employees to coursework. Nor will the Prime Minister's trip to Moscow this week help. It is good that in both Canada and Australia, politicians who believe in fair trade and not bullying have won. We are supposed to open markets, we are supposed to improve the business environment, we are supposed to attract companies and talent to Europe. But, yes, we also need to negotiate and negotiate patiently with the United States. But we also want fairness in trade. The huge digital giants and giants in Europe are making billions of euros. Is that fair? If we do not reach an agreement with the United States, the Commission must act and we will be its partners."
Vicent | Marzà Ibáñez,Verts/ALE,ES,257016,,"Señor presidente, señor comisario, las políticas arancelarias de Trump no son una guerra comercial. Son, sobre todo, un ataque a nuestros valores y a nuestra democracia. Es una lucha entre la oligarquía y los demócratas. Lo hemos visto en dos episodios recientemente. Primero, se ha hecho patente con el rechazo a la propuesta del comisario de generar un espacio de cero aranceles entre Europa y Estados Unidos, así como con el rechazo a la visita del ministro español de Economía, que terminó con una crítica directa a los impuestos que tenemos en la Unión Europea, una crítica directa a nuestra protección social, medioambiental y laboral. Por eso le pedimos, señor comisario, que no ceda al chantaje, que refuerce a nuestros trabajadores y trabajadoras y nuestra economía, que refuerce nuestra legislación medioambiental y ―sobre todo― que deje de pactar con el caballo de Troya de la Administración Trump aquí en Europa, que es la extrema derecha que nos quiere más débiles y más divididos. Por ello, le decimos alto y claro que no ceda al chantaje y que nuestros valores y nuestra democracia no están en venta.","Mr. Chairman, Commissioner, Trump's tariff policies are not a trade war.

First, it has been made clear with the rejection of the Commissioner's proposal to generate a zero-tariff space between Europe and the United States, as well as with the rejection of the visit of the Spanish Minister of Economy, which ended with a direct criticism of the taxes we have in the European Union, a direct criticism of our social, environmental and labor protection. That is why we ask you, Commissioner, not to give in to blackmail, to strengthen our workers and our economy, to strengthen our environmental legislation and -above all- to stop making pacts with the Trojan horse of the Trump Administration here in Europe, which is the extreme right that wants us weaker and more divided. Therefore, we tell him loud and clear that he should not give in to blackmail and that our values and our democracy are not for sale."

Die Vereinigten Staaten sind unser wichtigster Handelspartner, und viele Arbeitsplätze hängen hier in der Europäischen Union am Export. Wenn die US‑Administration einseitig unberechtigt Zölle verhängt und uns damit letztlich den Zollkrieg erklärt, müssen wir entschlossen und vor allen Dingen gemeinsam handeln. Ich finde, dass die Kommission richtig reagiert hat – besonnen: Sie haben nicht sofort Gegenzölle verhängt, Sie waren immer zum Dialog bereit, für Verhandlungen offen, haben hart verhandelt. Aber die Kommission hat sich auch vorbereitet, Gegenmaßnahmen zu verhängen, sofort zu reagieren, falls die Zölle scharf gestellt werden. Ich denke, es ist wichtig, daneben auch neue strategische Partner zu finden. Auch da muss ich der Kommission ein Kompliment aussprechen. Sie sind in der ganzen Welt unterwegs: Mercosur‑Abkommen ist abgeschlossen worden, mit Indien wird verhandelt, mit den ASEAN‑Staaten, mit afrikanischen Ländern. Ich begrüße alle diese Initiativen – das ist genau der richtige Weg – und bedanke mich und wünsche, dass Sie so weitermachen und erfolgreich auch weitere Handelsabkommen abschließen können.","Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Mr. Minister, ladies and gentlemen! US tariffs hit our companies to the core. The United States is our most important trading partner and many jobs here in the European Union depend on exports. If the US administration unilaterally imposes unjustified tariffs and ultimately declares a tariff war on us, we must act decisively and, above all, together. I think that the Commission has reacted correctly - prudently: You did not immediately impose counter-tariffs, you were always ready for dialog, open to negotiations, negotiated hard. But the Commission has also prepared itself to impose countermeasures, to react immediately if the tariffs are imposed. I think it is also important to find new strategic partners. Here, too, I must compliment the Commission. You are on the move all over the world: the Mercosur agreement has been concluded, negotiations are underway with India, with the ASEAN states and with African countries. I welcome all these initiatives - this is exactly the right way to go - and I thank you and hope that you can continue in this vein and successfully conclude further trade agreements."
Camilla | Laureti,S-D,IT,230085,,"Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, spesso quando si parla di guerre commerciali si mette l'accento sull'aggettivo ""commerciale"" ma bisogna metterlo sul sostantivo ""guerre"": queste sono le parole chiare e nette del Presidente Mattarella. Un monito a non dimenticare la storia che ha dimostrato come l'ostilità commerciale possa portare a scontri ancora più gravi. I dazi hanno già cominciato a fare danni prima che Trump li firmasse e poi li sospendesse per 90 giorni: imprese e lavoratori lamentano situazioni drammatiche con merci bloccate nei porti, anche a causa dell'incertezza. Novanta giorni è il tempo che ci è stato dato per mettere in campo una risposta che deve essere compatta, europea, per sventare una guerra commerciale che avrebbe conseguenze enormi per le nostre esportazioni, soprattutto nel settore agroalimentare, che nel 2024 ha toccato quota 30 miliardi di euro. I dazi colpiscono settori strategici come quello dell'agricoltura, fatta di prodotti di qualità e rispetto al quale è centrale il ruolo rivestito dal made in Italy. Tutelano invece prodotti di minore qualità. La posta in gioco è troppo alta: non possiamo permetterci divisioni e frammentazioni. Siamo ad un tornante della storia delicata e da come lo attraverseremo dipenderà il nostro futuro.","Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, often when we talk about trade wars we put the emphasis on the adjective ""trade"" but we need to put it on the noun ""wars"": these are the clear and sharp words of President Mattarella. A warning not to forget history that has shown how trade hostility can lead to even more serious clashes. The tariffs have already started to do damage before Trump signed them and then suspended them for 90 days: businesses and workers complain of dramatic situations with goods stuck in ports, also due to uncertainty. Ninety days is the time we have been given to deploy a response that must be compact, European, to foil a trade war that would have enormous consequences for our exports, especially in the agri-food sector, which in 2024 touched 30 billion euros. Duties affect strategic sectors such as agriculture, made up of quality products and with respect to which the role played by Made in Italy is central. Instead, they protect products of lesser quality. The stakes are too high: we cannot afford divisions and fragmentation. We are at a delicate hairpin bend in history, and how we cross it will determine our future."
Sebastian | Kruis,PfE,NL,256996,,"Voorzitter, allereerst wil ik commissaris Šefčovič bedanken voor zijn inzet om de handelsrelaties tussen de Europese Unie en de Verenigde Staten te verbeteren. Ik ben ook blij dat hij mijn voorstel om te streven naar wederzijdse 0 %-tarieven heeft overgenomen. Toch zien we dat, terwijl de commissaris probeert de plooien glad te strijken in onze handelsrelaties, er elders zand in de machine wordt gegooid. Zo legde Brussel vorige week opnieuw boetes op aan Amerikaanse techbedrijven, deze keer aan Meta en Apple. De Verenigde Staten hebben al eerder aangegeven dat zij dergelijke boetes beschouwen als economische barrières, die net zo schadelijk zijn als tarieven. Mijn vraag is dan ook: is het niet contraproductief dat Brussel met de ene hand onderhandelt over het afschaffen van tarieven en met de andere boetes uitdeelt die Washington als nieuwe tarieven beschouwt? Hoe denkt de commissaris dat dit kan bijdragen aan het sluiten van een goede deal? Laten we stoppen met het laten gijzelen van ons handelsbeleid door linkse partijen die, na hun herhaalde verlies bij de verkiezingen, plotseling een obsessie lijken te hebben ontwikkeld voor het straffen van grote techbedrijven. Handelsakkoorden bouw je immers met bruggen, niet met boetes. Laten we dus kiezen voor groei in plaats van ideologische vendetta's.","President, first of all I would like to thank Commissioner Šefčovič for his commitment to improving trade relations between the European Union and the United States. I am also pleased that he has accepted my proposal to seek reciprocal 0% tariffs. Yet while the commissioner tries to smooth out the creases in our trade relations, we see sand being thrown into the machine elsewhere. Last week, for example, Brussels again imposed fines on U.S. tech companies, this time Meta and Apple. The United States has previously indicated that it views such fines as economic barriers, as damaging as tariffs. So my question is: Isn't it counterproductive for Brussels to negotiate the elimination of tariffs with one hand and hand out fines that Washington considers new tariffs with the other? How does the commissioner think this can contribute to getting a good deal? Let's stop letting our trade policy be held hostage by leftists who, after their repeated losses in elections, seem to have suddenly developed an obsession with punishing big tech companies. After all, trade agreements are built with bridges, not fines. So let's choose growth over ideological vendettas."

I call on the Commission, above all, to keep a cool head and negotiate constructively and confidently. As already pointed out, a zero-for-zero tariff on industrial goods and rapid customs clearance are a win-win for both sides. Above all, we as the EU must not allow ourselves to be played apart or unthinkingly build too high walls ourselves. Let us not forget one thing: from both a historical and economic point of view, high trade tariffs always come back to sender like a boomerang. Let us avoid that."

I am satisfied that the Commission has so far reflected this, consulting Member States from drafting its counter tariff list and rightly deferring action following the 90-day delay to give diplomacy a chance. But should this pause end without substantive US engagement, we must be ready to respond firmly, proportionately, and as one.

They are based on figures taken completely out of thin air. The aim seems to be to destabilize the world and challenge the rules-based world order. But people around the world do not want this. This is also shown by the recent elections in Canada and Australia. In both countries, parties that clearly said no to division won. Instead, they have elected leaders who stand up for cooperation and who stand up for the rules of the international order and fair trade relations. These are important signals and a reminder that a different path is possible. It is precisely this path that we must stick to. The EU must continue to strengthen ties with like-minded countries. In a trade war, there are no winners, only ordinary people who pay more for less. That is why the EU must stand up for the fairness and responsibility that the Trump administration lacks."

Mas, no meio de tanta instabilidade e incerteza, há um dado adquirido: o mundo mudou, e a relação transatlântica não voltará a ser a mesma. Cabe-nos, por isso, reagir com unidade, mas também com visão estratégica. Não nos esqueçamos de que somos uma potência comercial. Temos de agir como tal. Hoje, a diversificação de mercados não é uma opção; é mesmo uma urgência. Mas temos de ser rápidos. Dou um exemplo: passaram cinco meses desde a assinatura do acordo Mercosul, que ainda está em fase de revisão jurídica e tradução nas línguas oficiais de cada Estado-Membro. Se queremos proteger o nosso mercado, a nossa indústria, os nossos empregos, temos de ser mais eficazes, porque, num mundo onde todos estão a disputar os mesmos mercados, quem chega tarde perde — e a Europa não pode perder.

Today yes, tomorrow no, and then nobody knows what's next. But in the midst of so much instability and uncertainty, one thing is certain: the world has changed, and the transatlantic relationship will never be the same again. It is therefore up to us to react with unity, but also with strategic vision. Let's not forget that we are a trading power. We have to act like one. Today, market diversification is not an option; it is an urgency. But we have to be quick. I'll give you an example: five months have passed since the signing of the Mercosur agreement, which is still undergoing legal revision and translation into the official languages of each member state. If we want to protect our market, our industry, our jobs, we have to be more effective, because in a world where everyone is competing for the same markets, whoever arrives late loses - and Europe cannot afford to lose.

Essa é, infelizmente, uma das competências que foram transferidas para a União Europeia e em que os Estados nacionais não têm hoje qualquer possibilidade de desenvolvimento da sua ação — o caso de Portugal é um exemplo flagrante disso. Mas a pergunta que lhe quero fazer tem que ver com outra dimensão: a Senhora Deputada não considera que mais importante ainda é a dinamização do mercado interno, aumentando o poder de compra, aumentando salários e pensões, para que, com a dinamização do mercado interno, fiquemos menos vulneráveis e menos expostos às consequências que têm decisões como aquelas que Donald Trump tem tomado nos Estados Unidos?

Unfortunately, this is one of the competences that has been transferred to the European Union and in which the national states today have no possibility of developing their action - the case of Portugal is a glaring example of this. But the question I want to ask you has to do with another dimension: don't you think it's even more important to boost the internal market, increasing purchasing power, increasing salaries and pensions, so that, by boosting the internal market, we are less vulnerable and less exposed to the consequences of decisions like those Donald Trump has made in the United States?

Portanto, eu creio que sim. Essas falhas estão identificadas já em vários relatórios, não só no relatório de Mario Draghi, mas também de Enrico Letta, em que nós temos também trabalho de casa para fazer e, portanto, a estratégia passa por, sim, diversificar os nossos mercados no comércio internacional, e sim, eliminar as barreiras que ainda existem no mercado interno europeu.","Thank you very much for your question.

So, I think so. These shortcomings have already been identified in various reports, not only in Mario Draghi's report, but also in Enrico Letta's, in which we also have homework to do and, therefore, the strategy involves, yes, diversifying our markets in international trade, and yes, eliminating the barriers that still exist in the European internal market."

Commissioner, in these ninety days we must negotiate as equals, with the security that comes from being the largest trading bloc and the largest internal market in the world. At the same time, we must prepare proportional counter-attack measures and support plans for the sectors that may be affected by the tariffs, as the government of Pedro Sánchez has done in Spain, with more than 14 billion euros. I hope the People's Party will side with our citizens, our workers and our businesses and vote for the plan this week.

În al doilea rând, că avem nevoie de restartarea industriei europene.

First, that we have too high taxes and duties in Europe; that is why we have stifled private initiative and that is why European companies have lost their competitiveness and are failing to innovate. Secondly, that we need to restart European industry. We need to start producing here again what is necessary for the development of our countries, not to rely so easily on imports of very cheap consumer goods. And, last but not least, that the retaliatory measures proposed by the European Commission are pathetic and there is no negotiating strategy. The Americans are putting taxes on steel and cars, and Brussels wants taxes on whisky and Harley-Davidson."
Marie-Pierre | Vedrenne,Renew,FR,197502,,"Monsieur le Président, Monsieur le Ministre, Monsieur le Commissaire, presque aucun pays n'est épargné, aucun secteur à l'abri. L'idéologie rôde dans les couloirs de la Maison-Blanche de Donald Trump, un protectionnisme brutal, assumé, sans règles ni limites. Certains, ici, embarrassés, peinent à cacher un fond de satisfaction. Leur projet devient réalité, appliqué avec zèle par une administration étrangère. D'autres voudraient nous entraîner dans une escalade sans fin: droits de douane contre droits de douane, barrières commerciales contre barrières commerciales. L'Union européenne, forte et unie, a choisi une autre voie, celle d'une riposte ciblée, proportionnée, suspendue, à ce stade, pour ne jamais rester opposée au dialogue. Monsieur le Commissaire, je vous soutiendrai tant que vous défendrez avec clarté et fermeté la prospérité internationale et les intérêts européens, et tant que vous serez prêt à utiliser tous les instruments que nous avons façonnés ensemble. Les choix protectionnistes américains constituent une opportunité, celle d'approfondir notre politique industrielle européenne avec des investissements massifs, mais aussi de renforcer des partenariats, de diversifier nos alliances pour enfin bâtir un ordre économique stable, juste et durable.","Mr. President, Mr. Minister, Mr. Commissioner, almost no country is spared, no sector immune. The ideology lurking in the corridors of Donald Trump's White House is one of brutal, assertive protectionism, with no rules or limits. Some here, embarrassed, struggle to conceal a hint of satisfaction. Their project is becoming reality, zealously applied by a foreign administration. Others would like to drag us into a never-ending escalation: tariffs against tariffs, trade barriers against trade barriers. The European Union, strong and united, has chosen another path, that of a targeted, proportionate response, suspended at this stage so as never to remain opposed to dialogue. Commissioner, I will support you as long as you defend international prosperity and European interests with clarity and firmness, and as long as you are prepared to use all the instruments we have fashioned together. America's protectionist choices represent an opportunity to deepen our European industrial policy with massive investment, but also to strengthen partnerships and diversify our alliances in order to build a stable, fair and sustainable economic order."
Bogdan Andrzej | Zdrojewski,PPE,PL,124893,,"Panie Przewodniczący! Panie Komisarzu! Panie Ministrze! Wszyscy doskonale wiemy, że decyzje dotyczące podatków, w tym ceł, nie powinny zapadać z dnia na dzień. Nie powinny być wdrażane z dnia na dzień. Doskonale wiemy, że większość przedmiotów, towarów powstaje nie w cyklach dziennych. Powstaje w bardzo skomplikowanym łańcuchu produkcji przez podmioty gospodarcze. Te podmioty gospodarcze oczekują, krótko mówiąc, stabilności. One kalkulują, liczą, szacują swoje koszty. Przedmioty też nie poruszają się w świecie z prędkością światła. Są transportowane taką lub inną drogą, ale to wymaga czasu, cierpliwości, pewnych kosztów. Główny więc dzisiaj apel jest o to, aby wszystkie takie decyzje zapadały z odpowiednim wyprzedzeniem, aby nie zapadały z dnia na dzień, aby nie powodowały druzgocących efektów, jeżeli chodzi o kalkulacje ekonomiczne. Przy tej okazji jedno podziękowanie. Kończy się polska prezydencja. Byłem dumny z niej jak byłem ministrem. Jestem dumny z niej w chwili obecnej. Chciałem panu ministrowi Adamowi Szłapce bardzo podziękować za stałą, adekwatną obecność na wszystkich naszych sesjach. Będziemy mieli jeszcze jedną w Strasburgu, a potem będziemy trzymać kciuki za prezydencję duńską. Wszystkiego dobrego!","Mr. Chairman, Mr. Commissioner! Mr. Minister! We all know very well that decisions on taxes, including customs duties, should not be made overnight. They should not be implemented overnight. We know very well that most items, goods are created not in daily cycles. It is created in a very complex chain of production by economic operators. These economic entities expect, in short, stability. They calculate, count, estimate their costs. Items don't move through the world at the speed of light either. They are transported by one route or another, but this takes time, patience, certain costs. So the main appeal today is that all such decisions should be made well in advance, that they should not be made overnight, that they should not cause devastating effects in terms of economic calculations. One thanks on this occasion. The Polish presidency is coming to an end. I was proud of it when I was minister. I am proud of it at the present time. I wanted to thank Minister Adam Szlapka very much for his constant, adequate presence at all our sessions. We will have another one in Strasbourg, and then we will keep our fingers crossed for the Danish presidency. All the best!"
Raphaël | Glucksmann,S-D,FR,197694,,"Monsieur le Président, Monsieur le Commissaire, chers collègues, le président des États-Unis est un «bully» qui voit le monde comme une cour de récréation et, face à un «bully», baisser les yeux ne sert à rien. Espérer passer entre les gouttes ne sert à rien non plus. Il faut montrer que l'Europe est forte. Alors plutôt qu'une approche classique, «tu taxes mon vin, je taxe ton whisky», une approche qui serait trop coûteuse pour nos entreprises et trop prévisible pour dissuader Trump, montrons que nous sommes prêts à cibler, le cas échéant, le cœur de sa puissance: les services digitaux américains, les piliers de la fameuse «broligarchie» trumpiste. En utilisant enfin la force de notre marché, appliquons nos lois sur le numérique, œuvrons ensemble à des alternatives européennes souveraines aux Amazon, Facebook, X et consorts. Le moment historique que nous traversons est celui de l'émergence en matière de commerce, de défense ou d'industrie d'une puissance européenne souveraine. Une puissance dont l'acte de naissance même est aussi un acte de divorce. Le choix que nous ferons maintenant définira la nature de l'Europe pour les décennies à venir. Le statu quo est impossible, alors il vous faut aller de l'avant.","Mr. Chairman, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States is a bully who sees the world as a playground, and when faced with a bully, there's no point looking down. Hoping to slip through the cracks doesn't help either. We need to show that Europe is strong. So rather than the classic ""you tax my wine, I'll tax your whisky"" approach, which would be too costly for our companies and too predictable to dissuade Trump, let's show that we're ready to target, if need be, the heart of his power: American digital services, the pillars of Trump's famous ""broligarchy"". Let's use the power of our market, enforce our digital laws, and work together for sovereign European alternatives to Amazon, Facebook, X and others. This is a historic moment for the emergence of a sovereign European power in trade, defense and industry. A power whose very act of birth is also an act of divorce. The choice we make now will define the nature of Europe for decades to come. The status quo is impossible, so you need to move forward."
Jean-Paul | Garraud,PfE,FR,197628,,"Monsieur le Président, cela fait un mois que les États-Unis imposent une surtaxe de 25 % sur les importations de voitures européennes. C'est un véritable coup de massue pour notre industrie automobile, déjà exposée à une sévère concurrence asiatique. Ce n'est ni un accident ni une surprise, Donald Trump avait clairement annoncé ses intentions; mais c'est surtout la conséquence directe de décennies d'absence de protectionnisme européen et d'ouverture de nos marchés à la terre entière. Sous couvert de transition écologique, la Commission européenne a détruit l'essentiel de nos filières industrielles, sacrifié nos motorisations thermiques, imposé de nombreuses normes destructrices et livré notre avenir automobile à la Chine sur l'autel du mondialisme et du tout électrique. Pendant que les États-Unis et Pékin protègent leurs industries, Bruxelles subventionne à coups de milliards des ONG militantes responsables d'une propagande anti-voiture. Pire encore, la Commission vient de proposer l'instauration d'un contrôle technique annuel obligatoire pour les véhicules de plus de dix ans et pour tous les automobilistes européens. Il s'agit d'une mesure punitive, injuste et injustifiée techniquement, qui ne vise qu'à culpabiliser, taxer et dissuader nos concitoyens d'utiliser leur véhicule. Ce harcèlement est insupportable pour des millions de familles qui dépendent de leur voiture dans leur vie au quotidien. Les résultats sont là: une industrie étranglée, des citoyens accablés et une Europe hors sol, incapable de défendre ses intérêts. Il est temps de suspendre le pacte vert, de restaurer la préférence européenne et la souveraineté nationale, d'exiger la réciprocité et de relocaliser nos productions stratégiques. Il est grand temps de sortir du mondialisme, de restaurer les États nations au sein d'une Union européenne des coopérations. C'est la seule solution d'avenir pour l'Europe.","Mr. President, it's been a month since the United States imposed a 25% surtax on European car imports. This is a real blow to our automotive industry, already exposed to severe competition from Asia. This is neither an accident nor a surprise - Donald Trump had clearly announced his intentions - but it is above all the direct consequence of decades of lack of European protectionism and the opening up of our markets to the whole world. Under the guise of ecological transition, the European Commission has destroyed most of our industrial sectors, sacrificed our internal combustion engines, imposed numerous destructive standards and handed over our automotive future to China on the altar of globalism and all-electricity. While the USA and Beijing protect their industries, Brussels subsidizes militant NGOs responsible for anti-car propaganda to the tune of billions. Worse still, the Commission has just proposed the introduction of mandatory annual roadworthiness tests for vehicles over ten years old, and for all European motorists. This is a punitive, unfair and technically unjustified measure, designed to make our fellow citizens feel guilty, tax them and discourage them from using their cars. This harassment is unbearable for the millions of families who depend on their cars in their daily lives. The results are there for all to see: a strangled industry, overburdened citizens and an out-of-touch Europe incapable of defending its own interests. It's time to suspend the Green Pact, restore European preference and national sovereignty, demand reciprocity and relocalize our strategic production. It's high time to get out of globalism, and restore nation states within a European Union of cooperation. This is the only way forward for Europe."
Marion | Maréchal,ECR,FR,256922,,"Monsieur le Président, certains ici semblent découvrir que les États-Unis sont un concurrent commercial féroce. Pourtant, les précédents ne manquent pas, sous l'ère Biden et Obama, par exemple contre la banque BNP Paribas, qui reçut une amende considérable, ou encore le rachat forcé d'Alstom et l'espionnage massif révélé par Snowden. Ceux qui ont autrefois favorisé notre dépendance militaire et économique redécouvrent aujourd'hui les vertus de la souveraineté et même du protectionnisme. Ironiquement, on pourrait remercier Donald Trump pour cela. Face à cette réalité, certains proposent d'aggraver encore notre déficit commercial avec la Chine. Ceci n'est pas une stratégie. Face au risque d'augmentation des droits de douane, la seule réponse durable, c'est un changement de modèle économique. Il n'y a pas de compétitivité possible tant que notre énergie coûtera 4 à 5 fois plus qu'aux États-Unis ou en Chine. Alors, plutôt que de critiquer Donald Trump, la priorité de l'agenda européen devrait être la baisse du coût énergétique et donc la sortie des objectifs irréalistes du pacte vert, la relance du nucléaire, l'autorisation de nouveaux forages et l'investissement dans des énergies renouvelables non intermittentes comme la géothermie.","Mr. President, some people here seem to have discovered that the United States is a fierce commercial competitor. Yet there is no shortage of precedents, under Biden and Obama, for example against the bank BNP Paribas, which received a considerable fine, or the forced takeover of Alstom and the massive espionage revealed by Snowden. Those who once favored our military and economic dependence are now rediscovering the virtues of sovereignty and even protectionism. Ironically, we can thank Donald Trump for this. Faced with this reality, some are proposing to further worsen our trade deficit with China. This is not a strategy. Faced with the risk of increased tariffs, the only sustainable response is to change our economic model. There can be no competitiveness as long as our energy costs are 4 to 5 times higher than in the United States or China. So, rather than criticizing Donald Trump, the priority on the European agenda should be lowering energy costs, and therefore getting out of the unrealistic targets of the Green Pact, reviving nuclear power, authorizing new drilling and investing in non-intermittent renewable energies such as geothermal power."
Paulo | Do Nascimento Cabral,PPE,PT,257048,,"Senhor Presidente, Senhor Comissário, a União Europeia e os Estados Unidos representam cerca de 30 % do comércio global, pelo que a imposição de tarifas impacta diretamente as nossas empresas e, sobretudo, os consumidores, ao refletirem-se nos preços finais, que aumentaram já cerca de 12 %. Há três premissas que devem ser seguidas pela União Europeia. Negociar, porque não podemos desistir do nosso aliado de sempre, e as relações transatlânticas são mais do que economia e balanças comerciais e exigem compromissos, pois assentam em valores, segurança e cooperação estratégica e transatlântica, com especial importância para o eixo Atlântico, onde Portugal e os Açores têm um papel relevante. Incentivar novas oportunidades de diversificação de parcerias comerciais, e destaco os acordos com o Mercosul, México e África do Sul. Sempre que Trump nos fecha uma porta, a União Europeia tem de abrir uma janela. Reforçar o nosso mercado interno, pois um estudo recente do Fundo Monetário Internacional estima que os custos das barreiras regulatórias dentro da União Europeia equivalem a tarifas de 44 % nos bens e até 110 % nos serviços. Reduzir estas barreiras mais do que mitigará o impacto das tarifas externas. Uma posição firme e coordenada da União na defesa dos seus interesses, com autonomia estratégica e com um mercado interno robusto, é a melhor garantia perante ameaças externas, venham elas de onde vierem.","Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union and the United States account for around 30% of global trade, so the imposition of tariffs has a direct impact on our companies and, above all, on consumers, as they are reflected in final prices, which have already risen by around 12%. There are three premises that the European Union must follow. Negotiate, because we can't give up on our long-standing ally, and transatlantic relations are more than economics and trade balances and require compromises, as they are based on values, security and strategic and transatlantic cooperation, with special importance for the Atlantic axis, where Portugal and the Azores play a major role. Encourage new opportunities to diversify trade partnerships, and I would highlight the agreements with Mercosur, Mexico and South Africa. Every time Trump closes a door, the European Union has to open a window. Strengthen our internal market, because a recent study by the International Monetary Fund estimates that the costs of regulatory barriers within the European Union are equivalent to tariffs of 44% on goods and up to 110% on services. Reducing these barriers will more than mitigate the impact of external tariffs. A firm and coordinated position by the Union in defense of its interests, with strategic autonomy and a robust internal market, is the best guarantee against external threats, wherever they come from."
Francisco | Assis,S-D,PT,28307,,"Senhor Presidente, Senhor Comissário, a nova liderança americana apresenta-se com um propósito claro — destruir a ordem global assente no direito internacional e substituí-la por uma visão transacional da relação entre Estados onde, inevitavelmente, o mais forte domina e impõe. Devemos deixar claro que o mercantilismo protecionista nunca foi e não será a solução, e que as tarifas impostas pelos Estados Unidos representam um retrocesso penalizador da economia global dos consumidores, sobretudo dos mais pobres e das empresas. Neste contexto, a Europa deve afirmar-se como a região do livre comércio e deve reforçar os laços com parceiros que nos são mais próximos. O acordo União Europeia-Mercosul ganhou, por isso, uma importância vital, não apenas pelo seu potencial económico, mas sobretudo pela sua dimensão geoestratégica e pela afirmação de valores comuns como a democracia, o Estado de direito e os direitos humanos. Há, contudo, um elemento essencial que não podemos perder de vista neste momento: enquanto Donald Trump e a sua administração são circunstanciais, a aliança transatlântica é duradoura e essencial. A Europa deve reagir com firmeza, mas também com inteligência e ponderação perante uma política errada e errática que prejudica, aliás, em primeiro lugar, a própria população norte-americana.","Mr. President, Commissioner, the new American leadership is presenting itself with a clear purpose - to destroy the global order based on international law and replace it with a transactional vision of the relationship between states where, inevitably, the strongest dominate and impose. We must make it clear that protectionist mercantilism has never been and will never be the solution, and that the tariffs imposed by the United States represent a backward step that penalizes the global economy, consumers, especially the poorest, and companies. In this context, Europe must assert itself as the region of free trade and must strengthen ties with our closest partners. The European Union-Mercosur agreement has therefore gained vital importance, not only because of its economic potential, but above all because of its geostrategic dimension and the affirmation of common values such as democracy, the rule of law and human rights. However, there is one essential element that we must not lose sight of at this time: while Donald Trump and his administration are circumstantial, the transatlantic alliance is lasting and essential. Europe must react firmly, but also intelligently and thoughtfully in the face of a misguided and erratic policy that is damaging, first and foremost, the US population itself."

The European Union must champion free trade as a source of growth and resilience. We cannot afford to fall into the trap of rising protectionist sentiment.

Francesco | Torselli,ECR,IT,257163,,"Signor Presidente, Signor Commissario, onorevoli colleghi, credo che la riflessione sulle relazioni commerciali fra Europa e Stati Uniti debba oggi svilupparsi su due differenti piani. Il primo, su cui penso e spero siamo tutti d'accordo, è che l'Unione europea debba dare una risposta univoca alle sollecitazioni che arrivano dall'altra sponda dell'Atlantico. Il secondo è che questa risposta non può essere solo il braccio di ferro, perché questo significherebbe mettere a repentaglio le nostre filiere produttive. Qualcuno in quest'Aula questa mattina ha parlato di sanzioni: ci rendiamo conto, Commissario, cosa significherebbe applicare delle sanzioni? Semmai a chi? L'Europa deve pensare invece alla diversificazione dei mercati, alla tutela dei produttori, allo scambio equo delle merci. E La lascio con una riflessione, caro Commissario: visitando aziende sul territorio, i nostri imprenditori non si dicono preoccupati soltanto per i dazi americani. Tutti ci chiedono di rivedere le folli decisioni prese in quest'Aula nella scorsa legislatura, che hanno imposto alle nostre imprese costi assurdi e standard irrealizzabili. Iniziamo col rimuovere questi dazi che l'Europa ha imposto a se stessa e andremo in una direzione migliore: abbiamo grande fiducia in Lei, Commissario.","Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the reflection on trade relations between Europe and the United States today should be developed on two different levels. The first, on which I think and I hope we all agree, is that the European Union has to give an unambiguous response to the solicitations coming from the other side of the Atlantic. The second is that this response cannot just be arm wrestling, because that would mean jeopardizing our production chains. Someone here this morning talked about sanctions: do we realize, Commissioner, what it would mean to apply sanctions? If anything, to whom? Instead, Europe must think about diversification of markets, protection of producers, fair trade of goods. And I leave you with a thought, dear Commissioner: visiting companies on the ground, our entrepreneurs say they are not only worried about U.S. tariffs. They are all asking us to review the crazy decisions made here in the last legislature, which imposed absurd costs and unworkable standards on our businesses.

The possible imposition of tariffs threatens to put a dent in our cooperation. There is still a great deal of confusion at the moment, but offence and emotion must not prevail. Europe must remain united and firm. As a representative of Estonia, a small open economy, I say clearly: we need rules-based trade, not arbitrary tariffs. At the same time, we cannot allow our businesses and workers to come under unfair pressure. I support the European Commission's efforts to find the best negotiated solution.

I am not criticizing our American friends because we are partners, but in everything they have done over the last decades, I would say that they have prioritized not the wages and living standards of those who work, but they have prioritized the capital growth of those who invest, and that should change in order to have peace and a proper transatlantic partnership."

Nuestros rivales comerciales nos quieren divididos. Por algo será. Negociemos hasta la extenuación con quien es nuestro principal socio comercial y aliado político, pero que sea consciente de que ante un ataque comercial tenemos herramientas y capacidad de respuesta. Y preparémosnos. Si Estados Unidos se repliega, busquemos nuevos mercados: ahí están México y Mercosur. Debemos cerrar más y mejores acuerdos.

We are a decisive global market: 450 million people with high purchasing power. We have the power to talk on equal terms with anyone - the United States, too. This trade war is in no one's interest; it is in no one's interest who started it. We must assert our unity. Member states cannot fall into the trap of waging war on their own. Our trade rivals want us divided. There is a reason for that. Let us negotiate to the point of exhaustion with our main trading partner and political ally, but let them be aware that in the face of a trade attack we have the tools and the capacity to respond. And let us prepare ourselves. If the United States withdraws, let us look for new markets: there is Mexico and Mercosur. We must conclude more and better agreements. Free trade is a fundamental principle of the European project: let us influence at a global level. In the face of national withdrawal, in the face of protectionism and tariffs, more free trade based on rules and more Europe."

We saw this in 2008, when families bore the brunt of the crash, and we can't let that happen again. We must protect those who keep our economies running: workers and small businesses. Real strength does not come from governments reneging on sick pay and living wage commitments, as the Irish Government has done, but from decent jobs, affordable housing and public investments. These tariffs are really about a perverse perception of power, and Europe must respond with unity and resolve. If Trump wants a trade war, we won't have started it, but we won't back down.

Salvatore | De Meo,PPE,IT,204333,,"Signor Presidente, Signor Commissario, onorevoli colleghi, le recenti tensioni commerciali con gli Stati Uniti ci ricordano quanto sia fragile l'equilibrio economico globale e quanto sia necessaria, oggi più che mai, una voce europea forte, coesa e credibile. Di fronte a delle misure unilaterali che rischiano di colpire interi settori strategici della nostra economia, la risposta dell'Unione non può essere frammentata o esitante: deve basarsi sul dialogo e su una strategia chiara e condivisa. Dobbiamo rafforzare il mercato unico, rimuovere le barriere interne che ancora oggi ne limitano il suo potenziale e investire con determinazione nella nostra competitività industriale e tecnologica. Ma il vero obiettivo deve essere più ambizioso: costruire una partnership economica strutturata con gli Stati Uniti e con il Canada, con zero dazi, con un libero scambio equilibrato e regole comuni che tutelino imprese, lavoratori e consumatori. Non possiamo limitarci a inseguire le scelte altrui. L'Europa ha le carte in regola per essere protagonista nel commercio ma potrà farlo solo se parla con una sola voce,rafforza la propria autonomia strategica e agisce con coraggio e serietà e lungimiranza. Un'Europa forte non teme il confronto ma lo guida.","Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the recent trade tensions with the United States remind us how fragile the global economic balance is and how a strong, cohesive and credible European voice is needed now more than ever. Faced with unilateral measures that risk affecting entire strategic sectors of our economy, the Union's response cannot be fragmented or hesitant: it must be based on dialogue and a clear, shared strategy. We must strengthen the single market, remove the internal barriers that still limit its potential, and invest with determination in our industrial and technological competitiveness. But the real goal must be more ambitious: to build a structured economic partnership with the United States and Canada, with zero tariffs, balanced free trade and common rules that protect businesses, workers and consumers. We cannot just chase others' choices. Europe has what it takes to be a major player in trade but it will only be able to do so if it speaks with one voice,strengthens its strategic autonomy and acts with courage and seriousness and foresight. A strong Europe does not fear confrontation but leads it."
Carmen | Crespo Díaz,PPE,ES,257034,,"Señor presidente, señor comisario, señores diputados, los noventa días [de suspensión de la aplicación de contramedidas] nos dan un respiro. Yo creo que la Comisión Europea lo está haciendo bien. Está siendo flexible, pero también firme. Sabemos que la guerra comercial no beneficia a nadie, pero Estados Unidos no lo sabe a pesar de que se está resintiendo. En 2018, la situación era diferente, pero ahora disponemos de legislación que podemos aplicar. La política arancelaria tiene que tener constancia, seriedad y unión. Ni viajes inoportunos a China ni —por supuesto—, en este caso, una postura incondicional con Trump. La unidad de acción es fundamental. La retirada de los aranceles a la soja y al gas natural es un acierto, como también lo es la retirada del bourbon y del vino. El sector agroalimentario tiene que quedar al margen porque no aguanta, no tiene colchón. Los costes de producción son elevados. Como dicen el Informe Letta y el Informe Draghi, en estos momentos tenemos que tratar la simplificación en muchos sectores, entre ellos en el agroalimentario. Debemos garantizar la soberanía alimentaria para ser más resilientes. Sí a los acuerdos comerciales, pero evitando la competencia desleal.","Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the ninety days [of suspension of the application of countermeasures] give us some breathing space. I believe that the European Commission is doing well. It is being flexible, but also firm. We know that the trade war benefits no one, but the United States does not know that even though it is suffering. In 2018, the situation was different, but now we have legislation that we can implement. Tariff policy has to have consistency, seriousness and togetherness. Neither inopportune trips to China nor - of course - in this case, an unconditional stance with Trump. Unity of action is essential. The withdrawal of tariffs on soybeans and natural gas is a wise move, as is the withdrawal of bourbon and wine. The agri-food sector has to remain on the sidelines because it cannot stand it, it has no cushion. Production costs are high. As the Letta Report and the Draghi Report say, at the moment we have to deal with simplification in many sectors, including the agri-food sector. We must guarantee food sovereignty in order to be more resilient. Yes to trade agreements, but avoiding unfair competition."

Ingeborg | Ter Laak,PPE,NL,256968,,"Voorzitter, sinds de installatie van Trump zijn de termen ""importheffing"" en ""handelstarief"" nog nooit zo populair geweest. Zijn protectionisme en onvoorspelbare beleid hebben de wereldeconomie op scherp gezet. De Verenigde Staten onder Trump zijn niet langer de stabiele partner die Europa gewend was. We moeten eerlijk zijn: Trump is onvoorspelbaar en dat zal zo blijven. Zijn tarievenpolitiek heeft geen afschrikkend effect, maar is inmiddels de standaard geworden. Waarom zouden we dan blijven hangen aan een onbetrouwbare partner? We hebben zekerheid en stabiliteit nodig. Het is aan ons, aan de politiek, om betrouwbaar en voorspelbaar te zijn. Zo niet, dan zullen bedrijven niet kunnen of willen investeren, terwijl dit juist broodnodig is voor ons concurrentievermogen en de klimaatinvesteringen. Europa en Nederland moeten hun handelsstrategie herzien. We moeten verder kijken naar andere markten, zoals Oekraïne, India, Afrika en Zuid-Amerika. Deze regio's bieden kansen voor nieuwe handelsovereenkomsten. Dit is geen luxe, maar een noodzaak. Als we toegang willen houden tot kritische grondstoffen, als we onze welvaart op peil willen houden, dan moeten we breder denken. De toekomst van onze economie hangt niet af van één onbetrouwbare president, maar van stabiele strategische allianties wereldwijd.","President, since Trump's inauguration, the terms ""import tariff"" and ""trade tariff"" have never been more popular. His protectionism and unpredictable policies have put the global economy on edge. The United States under Trump is no longer the stable partner Europe was used to. We must be honest: Trump is unpredictable and will continue to be so. His tariff policy does not deter, but has become the norm. So why hang on to an unreliable partner? We need certainty and stability. It is up to us, to politicians, to be reliable and predictable. If not, companies will not be able or want to invest, while this is desperately needed for our competitiveness and climate investments. Europe and the Netherlands must review their trade strategy. We need to look further into other markets, such as Ukraine, India, Africa and South America. These regions offer opportunities for new trade agreements. This is not a luxury, but a necessity. If we want to maintain access to critical raw materials, if we want to maintain our prosperity, we must think more broadly. The future of our economy depends not on one unreliable president, but on stable strategic alliances worldwide."
Miriam | Lexmann,PPE,SK,204336,,"Vážený pán predsedajúci, pán komisár. V týchto dňoch si pripomíname 80. výročie konca druhej svetovej vojny. Európa, ako ju poznáme, bola postavená na silnom transatlantickom zväzku a na spoločných hodnotách. Práve tie nám pomohli brániť sa proti totalitným režimom. Súčasný geopolitický kontext si vyžaduje odvážne strategické myslenie na najvyššej politickej úrovni a hľadanie udržateľnej spolupráce. Už od začiatku upozorňujem, že namiesto kritiky je potrebné konštruktívne rokovať so Spojenými štátmi a hľadať spoločné záujmy. Rozhodne by sme sa namiesto toho nemali nakláňať k nedemokratickým, totalitným režimom. Nemôžeme si dovoliť, aby dnes mali totalitné režimy príležitosť využiť naše nezhody. Flirtovanie s čínskou komunistickou stranou v konečnom dôsledku podkope našu ekonomiku, ale aj našu bezpečnosť a pošpiní dedičstvo všetkých, ktorí chránili hodnoty ľudskej dôstojnosti a demokracie, čiže základ Európskej únie.","Mr President, Commissioner. These days are the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. Europe as we know it was built on a strong transatlantic alliance and on shared values. It was these that helped us to defend ourselves against totalitarian regimes. The current geopolitical context requires bold strategic thinking at the highest political level and the search for sustainable cooperation. I have been pointing out from the outset that, instead of criticism, it is necessary to negotiate constructively with the United States and to seek common interests. We should certainly not be leaning towards undemocratic, totalitarian regimes instead. We cannot afford to allow totalitarian regimes today to have the opportunity to exploit our disagreements. Flirting with the Chinese Communist Party will ultimately undermine our economy, but it will also undermine our security and tarnish the legacy of all those who have defended the values of human dignity and democracy, which is the foundation of the European Union."
Francisco José | Millán Mon,PPE,ES,28400,,"Señor presidente, las relaciones económicas entre la Unión Europea y Estados Unidos son las más importantes del mundo. Computemos no solo el comercio de mercancías, sino también el de servicios y las inversiones. Las cifras demuestran la gran interconexión de ambas economías en beneficio mutuo. Una guerra de aranceles no es buena ni para consumidores, ni para trabajadores, ni para empresas, ni para la economía en general. Solo fomenta la inflación. Una economía tan boyante hasta hace meses como la de Estados Unidos registró el trimestre pasado un crecimiento negativo del 0,3 %, y es posible que entre en recesión este trimestre. Nosotros debemos continuar la negociación en curso con Washington. La Unión Europea debe plantear una agenda positiva y ambiciosa a Estados Unidos. La agenda debe incluir el comercio y la energía, cuestiones en materia tecnológica, y abordar también los desafíos que supone el comercio con China. Se puede añadir —por qué no— la contratación pública. Lástima no haber concluido la Asociación Transatlántica de Comercio e Inversión hace diez años, señor comisario. Qué lástima. En paralelo, tenemos que continuar diversificando nuestras relaciones económicas y comerciales a través de acuerdos como Mercosur y México, y las negociaciones con países asiáticos como la India. No olvidemos, señor comisario, profundizar en nuestro mercado único como pidió el Informe Letta el año pasado.","Mr. President, economic relations between the European Union and the United States are the most important in the world. Let's compute not only trade in goods, but also trade in services and investments. The figures demonstrate the great interconnectedness of the two economies to their mutual benefit. A tariff war is not good for consumers, workers, businesses or the economy as a whole. It only encourages inflation. An economy as buoyant as the U.S. economy until months ago recorded negative growth of 0.3% last quarter, and it is likely to go into recession this quarter. We must continue the ongoing negotiations with Washington. The European Union must present a positive and ambitious agenda to the United States. The agenda must include trade and energy, technology issues, and also address the challenges posed by trade with China. Public procurement can be added - why not? Too bad we did not conclude the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ten years ago, Commissioner. What a pity. In parallel, we must continue to diversify our economic and trade relations through agreements such as Mercosur and Mexico, and negotiations with Asian countries such as India. Let us not forget, Commissioner, to deepen our single market as the Letta Report called for last year."

If we do not take our citizens as partners to increase the purchase of European products and the development of European industry, we will have no way of convincing him - that is Mr Trump's freedom of decision, however much I criticise him. That is why, Commissioner, sure, we have a 90-day window, but what do we go to the negotiation with? We have to go in with solid arguments that, yes, the European Union market is important, to make it tempting for the United States and to manage to negotiate on a win-win principle.

Jaume | Asens Llodrà,Verts/ALE,ES,257015,,"Señor presidente, la guerra comercial de Trump es un síntoma de una crisis estructural, la del orden neoliberal que ha gobernado desde los años 80 el comercio global. Toda crisis es una oportunidad, no para volver a lo de antes o para imitar a Trump en una dinámica autodestructiva, sino para repensar el modelo desde parámetros más justos. Eso significa muchas cosas, pero —entre otras— fortalecer la soberanía democrática de nuestra economía, condicionar las importaciones al respeto de los estándares laborales y medioambientales. Significa también crear un espacio digital propio europeo, apostar por una multilateralidad más equilibrada y condicionar —impulsar— un control público de los sectores económicos estratégicos. Frente a los muros que levanta Trump, Europa debe levantar derechos. No debemos combatir el neoproteccionismo de Estados Unidos al servicio de las élites locales con más neoliberalismo al servicio de las élites globales. Por eso, otro mundo y otro comercio son posibles y urgentes.","Mr. President, Trump's trade war is a symptom of a structural crisis, that of the neoliberal order that has governed global trade since the 1980s. Every crisis is an opportunity, not to go back to business as usual or to imitate Trump in a self-destructive dynamic, but to rethink the model from fairer parameters. That means many things, but -among others- strengthening the democratic sovereignty of our economy, conditioning imports to the respect of labor and environmental standards. It also means creating a European digital space of our own, betting on a more balanced multilateralism and conditioning -promoting- a public control of strategic economic sectors. In the face of Trump's walls, Europe must build rights. We must not fight the neo-protectionism of the United States at the service of local elites with more neo-liberalism at the service of global elites.

Εμπορικοί πόλεμοι, κυνήγι σπάνιων γαιών, πηγών και δρόμων μεταφοράς ενέργειας και εμπορευμάτων συνδέονται άρρηκτα με τις αιτίες των πολέμων, ενώ τεράστια κεφάλαια συσσωρεύονται προετοιμάζοντας το έδαφος για νέα οικονομική κρίση του συστήματος εκμετάλλευσης.

Trade wars, the hunt for scarce land, sources and routes for transporting energy and goods are inextricably linked to the causes of the wars, while huge funds are being accumulated, preparing the ground for a new economic crisis of the system of exploitation. The peoples of Europe have no interest in becoming involved in the war and trade plans of the European Union, nor with its competitors. The only certainty is that the heavy bill of wars, tariffs and sanctions will be passed on to the peoples.

I don't know why nobody invites you. I've been invited by the Republicans and the presidential administration and at Washington CPAC, and three weeks ago at Mar-a-Lago, and I tell you I've talked to them directly. You can talk, but we're talking about the economy here. You, when you hire people or you put them on the list, you ask them what their sexual choices are instead of asking what their economic choices are and what their background is. With all due respect, but you are destroying Europe. Trump is defending his citizens and his country. You have destroyed Europe. Are you talking about dictatorship in the United States of America? Have you socialists been there? Well, I don't think there is more dictatorship in North Korea than in Europe, and you have destroyed democracy in Romania, where you have interfered in our elections, where we have fraudulent, illegal, unconstitutional elections and you have banned candidates, including me! This is what you should think about, how to make Europe democratic and Romania great again!"
João | Oliveira,The Left,PT,257083,,"Senhor Presidente, Senhor Comissário Šefčovič, a resposta à política de tarifas de Trump tem de assentar em três elementos essenciais. Primeiro, o reforço do mercado interno com o aumento do poder de compra, apoiando políticas de aumento de salários e de pensões. Reforçando o nosso mercado interno, temos uma economia menos dependente, menos vulnerável, menos exposta às decisões que outros tomam, sobretudo quando elas nos são prejudiciais. Em segundo lugar, precisamos de desenvolver as nossas capacidades produtivas, particularmente com uma política de reindustrialização e de incorporação de ciência e tecnologia na produção das nossas empresas para garantir que, também assim, ficamos menos vulneráveis e menos dependentes das decisões de política económica e comercial que outros tomam, nomeadamente quando decidem aumentar tarifas não apenas sobre bens, mas também sobre matérias-primas. Em terceiro lugar, é absolutamente essencial termos uma política comercial diversificada, com acordos de comércio que não sacrifiquem as economias e os interesses dos pequenos países face aos interesses das grandes potências e que, sobretudo, permitam encontrar formas adequadas de desenvolvimento económico na base de relações internacionais de cooperação. Esse é o caminho que deve ser seguido, não o da subserviência aos Estados Unidos e à administração de Trump.","Mr. President, Commissioner Šefčovič, the response to Trump's tariff policy must be based on three essential elements. First, strengthening the internal market by increasing purchasing power, supporting policies to increase wages and pensions. By strengthening our internal market, we have an economy that is less dependent, less vulnerable, less exposed to the decisions that others make, especially when they are harmful to us. Secondly, we need to develop our productive capacities, particularly with a policy of re-industrialization and the incorporation of science and technology into our companies' production to ensure that, in this way too, we are less vulnerable and less dependent on the economic and trade policy decisions that others make, particularly when they decide to increase tariffs not only on goods, but also on raw materials. Thirdly, it is absolutely essential that we have a diversified trade policy, with trade agreements that do not sacrifice the economies and interests of small countries in the face of the interests of the big powers and that, above all, allow us to find appropriate forms of economic development on the basis of cooperative international relations. This is the path that must be followed, not that of subservience to the United States and the Trump administration."
Ana | Miranda Paz,Verts/ALE,PT,24942,,"Senhor Presidente, a pausa do medo, a chantagem e os delírios do senhor Trump não podem ser o motor para a nossa política comercial europeia. Não podemos ceder à chantagem desse líder autoritário. É necessário avaliar imediatamente o impacto das taxas impostas por Trump: ameaça direta à soberania dos nossos povos, ameaça à economia e ao emprego e ameaça ao direito internacional. No meu país, a Galiza, a política intervencionista do senhor Trump ameaça o setor metalúrgico e do vinho, o setor automóvel e também outros setores. Precisamos, Senhor Comissário, de investimentos nesses setores estratégicos. Também precisamos de independência estratégica. E também, Senhor Comissário, de capacidade produtiva e de proteger a nossa indústria para evitar o dumping no emprego e o dumping social e económico.","Mr. President, Mr. Trump's pause for fear, blackmail and delusions cannot be the driving force behind our European trade policy. We cannot give in to the blackmail of this authoritarian leader. We must immediately assess the impact of the tariffs imposed by Trump: a direct threat to the sovereignty of our peoples, a threat to the economy and employment and a threat to international law. In my country, Galicia, Mr. Trump's interventionist policy threatens the metal and wine sector, the automobile sector and other sectors as well. Commissioner, we need investment in these strategic sectors. We also need strategic independence. And also, Commissioner, productive capacity and protecting our industry to avoid job dumping and social and economic dumping."
Juan Fernando | López Aguilar,S-D,ES,96812,,"Señor presidente, comisario Šefčovič, es evidente que el regreso de Trump a la Casa Blanca ha significado una patada al tablero del desorden global y que la disyuntiva está despejada en este debate. No cabe ni adelantarse ni desbaratarse, solo cabe una reacción unitaria de defensa de un mundo basada en reglas y en el multilateralismo, también en el comercio global. Pero hay un mensaje que no ha emergido todavía y en el que tenemos que ser especialmente unánimes, y es en decirle a Trump: «the EU was not meant to screw the US». En ningún caso la Unión Europea se hizo para fastidiar a Estados Unidos. La idea europea es endógena. La idea europea tiene valor en sí misma y la Unión Europea tiene que afirmarse con autonomía: autonomía estratégica y también autonomía frente a esas medidas unilaterales ante las que solo cabe oponer contramedidas justas y proporcionadas, pero, sobre todo, afirmando la autonomía y la razón de ser de la Unión Europea.","Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Šefčovič, it is clear that Trump's return to the White House has meant a kick to the chessboard of global disorder and that the choice is clear in this debate. There is no room for either getting ahead of ourselves or falling apart, there is only room for a united reaction in defense of a world based on rules and multilateralism, also in global trade. But there is one message that has not yet emerged and on which we must be particularly unanimous, and that is to say to Trump: ""the EU was not meant to screw the US"". In no way was the European Union made to screw the US. The European idea is endogenous. The European idea has value in itself and the European Union has to assert itself with autonomy: strategic autonomy and also autonomy in the face of these unilateral measures against which only fair and proportionate countermeasures can be opposed, but above all by asserting the autonomy and the raison d'être of the European Union."
Lucia | Annunziata,S-D,IT,257123,,"Signor Presidente, Signor Commissario, onorevoli colleghi, parlerò in italiano. Lei mi perdonerà se non parlo di dazi ma di Gaza. Queste due vicende in realtà rispondono alla stessa idea di politica: la sostituzione da parte di Trump dell'interesse pubblico con quello privato. Tutti sappiamo che tra sei giorni il presidente Trump sarà a Gerusalemme nella sua prima visita internazionale. E Bibi Netanyahu, il suo governo, ha pensato di presentargli in quella situazione un regalo. Sappiamo dal piano che è stato approvato ieri che il governo intende invadere Gaza per spostare i palestinesi dal loro territorio e intende poi affidare il loro benessere solo alle organizzazioni di beneficenza private. Questo significa una cosa molto importante: significa l'abolizione di un'altra pagina della nostra democrazia, che è stata fatta di società di intermediazioni, di una politica di intermediazione. Fuori saranno dunque le organizzazioni umanitarie, quelle degli Stati, la stessa ONU in definitiva, ma anche le nostre. Io guardo a questo anno che sono stata qui e non ho notato altro che l'incapacità di fare differenza in Palestina. Ma non preoccupatevi: i fantasmi dei fallimenti stanno sempre alle nostre porte.","Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will speak in Italian. You will forgive me if I speak not about tariffs but about Gaza. These two events actually respond to the same idea of politics: Trump's substitution of public interest for private interest. We all know that in six days President Trump will be in Jerusalem on his first international visit. And Bibi Netanyahu, his government, thought to present him in that situation with a gift. We know from the plan that was approved yesterday that the government intends to invade Gaza to move the Palestinians out of their territory and then intends to turn over their welfare only to private charities. This means one very important thing: it means the abolition of another page of our democracy, which has been made up of intermediary societies, of a policy of intermediation. So out will be the humanitarian organizations, those of the states, the UN itself ultimately, but also our own. I look at this year that I have been here and I have noticed nothing but the inability to make a difference in Palestine. But don't worry: the ghosts of failures are always at our doorstep."
Vytenis Povilas | Andriukaitis,S-D,EN,119652,,"Mr President, dear Commissioner, dear Maroš, I welcome your statement today. The predictable unpredictability of Trump's policies is a challenge, and Trump's brutal tariff war and nationalist protectionism are a real threat. We must stay united and determined in promoting and defending rule‑based global trade and multilateralism, and, of course, we need to intensify trade with other markets like Mercosur, and modernise and capitalise on the benefits of existing free trade agreements, as with Canada and Mexico. But we must also urgently complete our single market, urgently provide EU‑wide targeted support for impacted European industries and our affected regions. State aid to our industries and small and medium-sized enterprises is necessary. We must buy European goods and services and promote Made in Europe products. Our strategic, industrial and autonomy demands it.","Mr President, dear Commissioner, dear Maroš, I welcome your statement today.

Dariusz | Joński,PPE,PL,257031,,"Panie Przewodniczący! Panie Komisarzu! Wartość ceł nakładanych przez Stany Zjednoczone na unijny eksport to wzrost z 7 mld euro w 2023 r. do 81 mld euro w 2025 r. To jest prawie 74 mld euro więcej. Około 70% produktów unijnych eksportowanych do Stanów będzie podlegać dodatkowej opłacie. Oczywiście najbardziej dotknięty zostanie sektor motoryzacyjny. Unijny eksport wart mniej więcej 66 mld euro zostanie obłożony w kwocie 16,5 miliarda euro dodatkowymi opłatami. To również dotyczy mojego kraju, bo produkujemy 800 tysięcy samochodów, a w tym sektorze pracuje 200 tysięcy osób. Mówiąc wprost, globalna gospodarka może stracić nawet 7% PKB. To równowartość gospodarek Niemiec i Francji razem wziętych. Unia Europejska nie chce wojny celnej, ale chce partnerstwa. Dlatego ta propozycja zerowych ceł w dwie strony jest bardzo rozsądną i oczekiwaną – myślę, że z dwóch stron - propozycją.","Mr. Chairman, Commissioner, the value of the tariffs imposed by the United States on EU exports is up from €7 billion in 2023 to €81 billion in 2025. The value of tariffs imposed by the United States on EU exports is an increase from 7 billion euros in 2023 to 81 billion euros in 2025. This is almost 74 billion euros more. About 70% of EU products exported to the States will be subject to the additional levy. Of course, the automotive sector will be most affected. EU exports worth roughly €66 billion will be burdened to the tune of €16.5 billion in additional fees. This also affects my country, as we produce 800,000 cars, and 200,000 people work in this sector. Simply put, the global economy could lose up to 7% of GDP. That's the equivalent of the economies of Germany and France combined. The European Union doesn't want a tariff war, but it does want a partnership. Therefore, this proposal of zero tariffs both ways is a very reasonable and expected - I think from both sides - proposal."
Maroš | Šefčovič,NULL,EN,0,Member of the Commission,"Mr President, honourable Minister, honourable Members of the European Parliament, first and foremost, Mr President, I would like to thank you for organising the work of this House in a way that we can have regular debates on issues of strategic importance. Yesterday we had an excellent debate on the future relationship with the United Kingdom. Today we are discussing how we should advance our negotiations and relationship with the United States of America. I see that Chairman Lange is here. I also would like to appreciate the almost-permanent interaction with the INTA Committee and with all relevant committees, because clearly this is such an important issue that we have to act united, we have to work together and we have to be properly informed. We always seek, of course, the input and guidance from the European Parliament in these very important issues. Today's debate was one of the most profound, and also one of the longest, which just reflects the importance of the topic we are discussing. I really would like to thank all of you, because the overall impression I've got is that we understand each other very much on how to pursue what I would describe as a four-pillar policy. The first one – Mr Warborn mentioned it, but also a lot of other colleagues, Mr Procaccini, Mr Kols, Ms Vedrenne – that we should use every opportunity to engage with our American partners to negotiate and to look for fair and – I would underline – balanced solutions. As you can imagine, it's not easy. But I can also reassure you that we will do our utmost to arrive at that destination, because we, as the biggest trading partner of the United States of America, with millions of jobs to be affected by these measures on both sides of the Atlantic, feel responsibility for making sure that we find the best possible solution for both of us. Many of you proposed ideas which, frankly, we already tested. We proposed and we are waiting for the reaction from our American partners. For example, zero-zero tariffs for cars, but also for industrial goods, looking at what we can do in different certification processes to make sure that we make it easier for our businesses, and not more complicated, for them to actually profit from this biggest, most massive trade relationship on this planet. I was personally discussing with the Secretary of Commerce, Mr Lutnick, and Mr Jamieson Greer, who is leading the USTR offices, on multiple occasions, and we spent together dozens and dozens of hours on where we would be much stronger if we would act together. Let's tackle the dependencies, if it comes to critical raw materials, if it comes to key supply materials for our medicines. Let's tackle together overcapacity in the steel sector, because these are the areas where we can clearly achieve much more together if we work as allies, as partners. So let's see what would be the reaction from our American partners. At the same time, I would like to reassure everyone, especially Mr López Aguilar, that we do not feel weak. We do not feel under undue pressure to accept the deal which would not be fair for us. We are absolutely clear that we are the biggest trading bloc on this planet, with a very strong economy and with the biggest network of free trade agreements. We know that these negotiations might not, in the end, succeed, in spite of all our sincere efforts. So therefore we, of course, are preparing for the possible – and it might be needed – rebalancing. As you've been informed about our first set of measures, which we suspended because we wanted to create space for negotiations, so we will be continuing our preparation for further rebalancing if needed. I would like to reassure all of you that all options are clearly on the table. The third very important element raised by many of you is that we have to highlight that these tariffs are simply unjust, unfair and in total breach of international commercial law. Therefore we are also considering other options and to challenge these measures in the WTO. So we are fully aware how important this is. All the trading world is looking at making sure that we will come back to the rules-based international trade, to respect of the rules for all of us, because this is how international trade should function in the future. The last point – and thank you very much to those who mentioned it so clearly, Ms Van Brempt, Ms Hahn, Ms Niebler – and I appreciate also the support from Mr Oliveira – who were highlighting the importance of diversifying our trade relations. We have to make sure that we would get the most out of 87 % of global trade. I can tell you that our phones are not stopping ringing all the time, because everyone wants to accelerate free trade agreements, negotiations with us. Everyone wants to open them if they are not open, and we are clearly opening more avenues. I am sure that after this mandate, the European Commission will have much larger free trade networks than it has right now, and it will be clearly to the benefit of our workers, of our businesses, of our SMEs, because we are going to open access for the new markets and we are going to promote the European, fair, sustainable way of trading. If you allow me on the last point, Mr President, I totally agree with you that we need not only to look abroad, but also to look at what we can do better inside of our European Union. This particular situation with the tariffs is highlighting that also on our internal market, we still have too many barriers which are limiting the potential of our single market, which are making it difficult for our businesses, especially for our SMEs, to thrive even more on the single market. Therefore, Executive Vice-President Mr Séjourné was clearly tasked by our President, Ursula von der Leyen, to focus on this like a laser beam – to remove the tariffs, to increase the potential of the single market – because that's a very strong response. This is where we could be much more forceful than in the past. I believe that the combination of all these measures would make sure that Europe will not only remain the biggest trader on this planet, but also the strongest economy we have, and in close cooperation with the partners who share the same ideals, the same principles, when it comes to international trading.","Mr President, honourable Minister, honourable Members of the European Parliament, first and foremost, Mr President, I would like to thank you for organising the work of this House in a way that we can have regular debates on issues of strategic importance.

Socialists are in favor of a negotiated solution, but also of a response with determination, speed, proportionality and unity. We are in favor of multilateralism as opposed to the unilateralism advocated by the US; a world based on rules as opposed to unilateral decisions outside the established and agreed order of trade cooperation."
César | Luena,S-D,ES,197721,,"En materia de comercio este es el asunto que más está preocupando a la UE y a las instituciones multilaterales: los efectos sobre la economía y sobre el orden político y económico mundial de las líneas políticas y en este caso, comerciales, de la nueva administración norteamericana.

Iuliu | Winkler,PPE,RO,39725,,"Sistemul economic global este zguduit din temelii, iar viitorul este extrem de greu de întrevăzut mai ales din cauza imprevizibilității de care dă dovadă Washingtonul. Nu este pentru prima dată când europenii se află sub spectrul războiului comercial. Este însă pentru prima oară când consecințele acestuia sunt extrem de profunde și ample pentru că trăim în plină eră a globalizării cu lanțuri de aprovizionare strâns legate. Avem un respiro de trei luni în care trebuie să fim înțelepți, determinați și decisivi în negocierile cu SUA. În noile condiții, este esențial ca să ne păstrăm calmul și să le reamintim tuturor partenerilor că UE este de încredere și predictibilă. Comerțul este o competență exclusivă a Uniunii și doar păstrând unitatea, negociatorii noștri pot să se bazeze pe puterea pieței unice și a celor 450 de milioane de cetățeni europeni. UE are nevoie, mai mult ca niciodată de diversificarea relațiilor comerciale, fiind important să finalizăm negocierile aflate în curs cu state din Asia de Sud-Est, cu Australia sau India. Păstrând aceste priorități și mergând pe drumul marcat de interesele, dar și de valorile noastre europene, vom reuși să rămânem punctul de stabilitate în mijlocul unei economii globale extrem de turbulente.","The global economic system is being shaken to its foundations and the future is extremely difficult to predict, not least because of Washington's unpredictability. This is not the first time Europeans have been under the spectre of trade war. It is, however, the first time that the consequences are extremely deep and far-reaching because we are living in an era of globalization with closely linked supply chains. We have a breathing space of three months in which to be wise, determined and decisive in negotiations with the US. In the new circumstances, it is essential that we keep calm and remind all partners that the EU is reliable and predictable. Trade is an exclusive competence of the Union and it is only by remaining united that our negotiators can rely on the strength of the single market and 450 million European citizens. More than ever, the EU needs to diversify its trade relations, and it is important to finalize ongoing negotiations with South-East Asian countries, Australia or India. By maintaining these priorities and pursuing the path marked by our European interests and values, we will be able to remain a point of stability in the midst of a highly turbulent global economy."
