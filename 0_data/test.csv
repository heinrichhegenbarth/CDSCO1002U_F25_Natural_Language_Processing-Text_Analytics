The recent unilateral tariffs targeting European industries not only violate WTO frameworks but risk destabilizing transatlantic relations—a partnership we value yet cannot allow to be weaponized against our economic sovereignty. Solidarity among member states is non-negotiable: we must leverage our collective market power to enact proportionate, WTO-compliant countermeasures while intensifying dialogue to de-escalate tensions. Simultaneously, this moment demands proactive EU leadership in diversifying global trade alliances, particularly with emerging economies in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, through ambitious, values-driven agreements that prioritize sustainability, digital innovation, and reciprocal market access. By uniting internally and expanding externally, we transform challenges into opportunities to reinforce Europe’s role as a guardian of rules-based trade and a magnet for equitable growth."

Our strength lies in our unity, and it is through this unity that we can protect our interests and assert our position on the global stage. The US, an important trade partner, has recently implemented measures that we believe to be unjustified and potentially harmful to our economies.
