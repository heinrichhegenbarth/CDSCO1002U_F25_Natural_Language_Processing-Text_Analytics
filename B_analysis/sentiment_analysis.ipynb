The EU, with its economic prowess and influence, has the capacity to foster stronger trade alliances with emerging markets in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

We must strive for a balanced approach, which while acknowledging the U.S. as an important trade partner, also takes into account the potential negative impacts of such measures on our economies. In the face of this, we should not overlook the global trade opportunities that are presenting themselves. Emerging markets in Asia, Africa, and Latin America offer promising prospects that we should capitalize on. Therefore, I propose that we double down on our efforts to strengthen our trade ties with these regions. This two-pronged approach, of a measured response to the Trump administration and a proactive pursuit of new global trade opportunities, would ensure the sustained growth and prosperity of our Union."

         "in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, honourable Members, Commissioner, the EU-US trade and investment partnership is the most valuable in the world. I am convinced that we have a shared interest in protecting this mutually beneficial partnership and working together on common challenges. In this context, we deeply regret the recent increases of US tariffs applied on a very broad range of EU goods. We think that the imposition of additional tariffs, both universal and sectoral ones, is unjustified and arbitrary. These tariffs are damaging for prosperity. They negatively impact economic growth, foremost in the US but also globally, as confirmed by the IMF and WTO in their latest forecasts. Tariffs are taxes paid by businesses and ultimately by consumers. They will raise the cost of imports, disrupt supply chains and force companies to either absorb the cost or pass them on through higher prices, building up inflation. We welcome the 90-day suspension of a portion of the recently imposed US universal tariffs. At the same time, we are deeply concerned by many tariff increases remaining in place and possible new tariffs. More importantly, we are very concerned by the uncertainty that the US Administration announcements brought to the global economy. We understand that the US seeks to strengthen the resilience of its domestic industrial base and to enhance its economic security, but we believe that the announced tariffs are not the right way to achieve these goals. On behalf of the Council, I can assure you that we are united in our readiness to engage in a constructive dialogue with the US. Our priority is clearly to agree on a solution that is balanced and mutually beneficial, and that brings about more predictable trade and investment conditions. We believe that there is sufficient scope for delivering such a solution, but it is clear that significant joint efforts will still be needed to get there. We welcome recent concrete steps made by the Commission in the form of an offer of negotiations in selected areas. This step has full backing from the Council. As a clear sign of our good faith and our restraint, we have temporarily suspended the first set of countermeasures. It is also a sign of us not wishing to add to the already an unprecedented levels of economic uncertainty. But let me be clear: we will defend our legitimate interests and rights if we have to, and we will do so in a united, targeted and measured manner. There is a broad agreement in the Council on the need to work on possible further countermeasures, which would complement those already adopted. Our countermeasures can be fully reversed at any time if a negotiated solution is found. If, however, negotiation failed to deliver the desired outcome, we will consider taking further steps, keeping all options on the table, including a WTO complaint. We are working closely with the Commission. We are carefully assessing not only the effects of new US tariffs on EU exports, but also monitoring any unwanted indirect effects. We simply cannot absorb global overcapacity, we cannot accept dumping on our markets. Mr President, honourable Members, Commissioner, in these challenging times, we remain committed to the rules-based international order, as we continue to believe in an open and predictable global trading system that benefits all partners. We are engaging with our international partners both through multilateral fora as well as bilaterally. That is why the issue of possible trade diversion is firmly on our radar screen. In the Council, there is a broad agreement on the importance of deepening our existing partnerships around the world, as well as sealing new win-win deals. Finally, I want to underline that in times of growing uncertainty, the single market stands as a vital source of stability and resilience. The new situation we are facing gives an additional sense of urgency in implementing the new European competitiveness deal. We will therefore be stepping up our work in the Council towards lifting the remaining barriers to the proper functioning of our single market and boosting its potential.",

         "Mr President, honourable Members, dear Minister, dear Andre, first and foremost, I would like to appreciate that we have this very timely debate this morning, because it would allow us to have a deep look at the current state of our relationship between the European Union and the United States of America in the field of bilateral trade and economic cooperation. As was already highlighted by the Minister, we have built, together with the United States, over the years the largest bilateral and investment relationship in the world. Today, the European Union is by far the most important economic partner of the United States. Our trade in goods and services has doubled over the last decade, surpassing EUR 1.7 trillion in 2023, with EUR 851 billion of trade in goods and EUR 746 billion of trade in services. And for us, likewise, the US is our biggest trading partner. Our business communities have invested strongly on both sides. Total bilateral investment stocks reached EUR 5.3 trillion in 2022. Direct EU investment in the US is worth of EUR 2.7 trillion, making the EU companies the largest foreign investor in the United States of America. On top of it, I think it is very important to underline that European companies, EU firms directly employ 3.4 million people in the US, with millions more American workers, farmers and ranchers benefiting indirectly. Trade and investment between the European Union and the United States are therefore key building blocks of our shared prosperity, technology and research prowess, as well as remaining fundamental to our economic security. So it is evident that we have a mutual interest in nurturing and further developing our economic links and in making our partnership and relationship stronger. But as you know very well, honourable Members, our trade relations are currently facing strong headwinds. The US has unilaterally increased its import duties on EU goods in a significant manner. These import taxes are unjustified and cause economic harm on both sides of the Atlantic. They disrupt supply chains and affect global markets. They hurt EU and US companies, workers and farmers. They create uncertainty for transatlantic investment. They raise prices for consumers and businesses and increase inflation in the US. The US has temporarily decreased its universal additional tariffs from 20 % to 10 %. In response, we have shown significant goodwill by pausing our rebalancing measures on the steel and aluminium tariffs for 90 days. With this pause, we want to give space for negotiations. However, US tariffs still cover EUR 380 billion‑worth of EU exports to the US, corresponding to 70 % of our total exports, at rates between 10 % to 25 %. In addition, more US tariff actions could well be on their way, even though the US has acknowledged that the EU poses no problem and in fact shares many common challenges. On top of the ongoing investigation on lumber, the US has recently launched new Section 232 investigations based on national security grounds on: pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical ingredients; semiconductors, including semiconductor manufacturing equipment; critical minerals, also covering processed critical minerals and the derivative products; and, most recently, on tracks and track parts. This makes in total six additional ongoing investigations. If all these investigations lead to unjustified harmful tariffs, then another EUR 170 billion of EU exports to the US would be impacted. This means that in total around EUR 549 billion of EU exports to the US, meaning 97 % of the total would be subject to tariffs. In the terms of duties collected, this will be massive. In 2024, the US collected around EUR 7 billion in duties on EU exports. The projection is that the US might now collect as much as EUR 100 billion if the ongoing investigations result in tariffs. And, as you know, just yesterday we learnt about a new possible 100 % tariff on non‑US film production. So I believe that you would agree with me that the situation as such is not acceptable and we cannot afford to stay idle. And this brings me to our response. Honourable Members, we are not facing these headwinds on autopilot. As you know, President von der Leyen has entrusted me to engage with the US administration to try and find fair and mutually beneficial negotiated solutions and return to a constructive trade relationship. I am in constant contact with my US interlocutors for this purpose. In order to get these negotiations up and running, we have been scoping out the possibility to reduce barriers, not raise them, including by: proposing to agree on zero‑for‑zero tariffs for all industrial goods, including in strategic industrial sectors such as cars and car parts; jointly addressing global overcapacity in strategic industrial sectors such as steel and aluminium; jointly increasing the resilience of EU and US supply chains in sectors such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals; and securing a return to barrier‑free transatlantic trade and reviving our cooperation. So the EU has made clear that we are ready to discuss and we are ready to find mutually beneficial solutions respecting our interests and regulatory autonomy. We now need the US to show its readiness to make progress towards a fair and balanced solution. And I have already shared the approach with my US counterparts as a basis for further engagement. We are fully engaged in discussion with the US, as a negotiated solution remains our clear and preferred outcome. But if our talks with the US do not yield the necessary result, we will be ready for alternatives, with the aim of restoring a level playing field. Therefore, we are also using the 90‑day pause to continue our preparation for further rebalancing measures to counter the multitude of additional US tariffs on EU exports and ensure a level playing field in the longer term. And here I would like to underline that all options remain on the table. We are also preparing for litigation to preserve and reinforce the multilateral rules‑based trading system. At the same time, we are monitoring possible risks of trade diversion, by way of a Dedicated Import Surveillance Task Force, where the aim is to protect the EU market from possible surges of imports from other countries that are also hit by US tariffs and which seek alternative markets. The first results of this work are anticipated in mid‑May. The Commission stands ready, if necessary, to use all available tools in our trade defence instrument toolbox in a rapid manner to protect the EU single market, EU producers and EU consumers. We will also, honourable Members, continue diversifying our trade and investment ties with partners around the globe. This includes making the most of our extensive network of trade agreements with 76 countries across the globe, covering almost half of our trade, and doubling down on our efforts to finalise ongoing negotiations. Here, we know that countries around the world are looking at the EU as a trusted, reliable and predictable trading partner. In the current global environment, it is in everyone's interest to expand their network and strengthen their supply routes. For us, it is nothing less than a prerequisite for our competitiveness and our economic security that we find new markets for our exporters and new sources of imports, and it also helps double down on rules‑based trade, while we continue to push for proper multilateral governance with the WTO at its core. The US represents 13 % of global trade. It's a lot, but we must not forget about the remaining 87 %. And, therefore, work continues internally towards the adoption of signature of agreements with Mercosur and Mexico. These are perfect examples of deals we have made that can deliver hugely on our bid for diversification, to open new markets and further important geopolitical relations, while also securing key commitments on issues of climate change and sustainability. They offer significant opportunities for EU businesses and high potential for EU consumers. There is still work to be done to get them over the line. However, I count on the support of this House to ensure successful outcomes for the benefit of all. To conclude, Mr President, I also would like to inform the honourable Members that we are accelerating dramatically our ongoing negotiations with: India – we had very successful meetings just last week; Indonesia, where I had the important VTC yesterday; Philippines; Thailand; and Malaysia. As you know, we launched the free trade agreement talks with the United Arab Emirates, something which I believe could serve as a strong catalyst to advance our cooperation with the Gulf Cooperation Council countries with whom we are also negotiating strategic partnership agreements. So while we are pushing our FTA agenda forward, we are also making use of other, more flexible forms of engagement tailor‑made to our own needs and those of our respective partners, covering specific sectors and deepening our bilateral relations. Let me just conclude by highlighting that we are working very closely with Angola in implementing the Sustainable Investment Facilitation Agreement, which entered into force in 2024. And we are working closely with our partners on critical raw materials, but also on the digital trade agreements reached with South Africa earlier this year, and with Singapore, which I will be signing there on behalf of the EU this week. We are working very closely with South Africa also to advance our Clean Trade and Investment Partnership to strengthen our clean supply chains, which we hope to conclude by the end of 2025. My last, last point would be an appeal to all of us, and I would like to thank the Polish Presidency for excellent cooperation on making sure that our unity is unshakeable, that we act as one if it comes to these very important trade negotiations, because this is as vital as ever. And I would say that this is the time to act in unequivocal terms for the EU's interest and towards our goal of maintaining a strong and competitive economy as well as cohesive society.",

         "Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, colleagues, we find ourselves at a historic crossroads, not just in terms of economic policy, but also in the broader context of global geopolitics. Trade tension, of course, is nothing new. But today, in an era of deep globalisation and tightly interlinked supply chains, the consequences are more far-reaching than ever. We have seen this clearly in the past months, when Trump's erratic trade measures triggered volatility across financial markets. The EU's response, especially in the face of the unjustified trade measures from a long-standing ally, will be remembered. Our approach must strike a careful balance, preserving the principle of trust, respect and transatlantic cooperation, while also shielding European citizens and industries from economic harm. I therefore call on the Commission to act decisively within their 90-day retaliatory pause. The current pause from the Trump administration is de facto a 25 % tariff on EU steel, aluminium and automobiles and a 10 % tariff on almost all other goods. The Commission's decision to hold off on immediate retaliation is wise; de-escalation creates a space for dialogue. But let us be clear: inaction cannot become our policy. Within these 90 days, we must prepare a strong and measured and unified response. At the same time, we must do three things to strategically position Europe: strengthen the single market, negotiate and ratify more free trade agreements, not least Mercosur and the one with Mexico, and reassert leadership within WTO, because we need the rules-based international system when there is unpredictability in the world.",

         "Señor presidente, querido comisario Šefčovič, Donald Trump y su visión del mundo son una amenaza directa no solo para el comercio internacional, sino también para los valores que sustentan nuestras democracias. Su guerra comercial contra la Unión Europea, con aranceles injustificados, amenazas a nuestras industrias y chantajes permanentes, es la manifestación más evidente de un nacionalismo económico autoritario que desprecia el derecho internacional y la cooperación entre iguales. Trump y sus socios de extrema derecha —dentro y fuera de la Unión Europea— no creen en un mundo ordenado por normas, sino en la ley del más fuerte. Frente a su embestida, no podemos ni debemos titubear. Estamos aquí para defender con firmeza el modelo europeo, un modelo basado en la justicia social, en el Estado del bienestar y en una economía que pone en el centro a las personas. La Unión Europea debe responder con contundencia. Nuestra respuesta debe desplegarse en varios frentes: la protección de nuestros trabajadores, consumidores y empresas; la defensa del orden internacional basado en reglas, con una Organización Mundial del Comercio fuerte y reformada; y la negociación frente a Trump desde una posición de firmeza, sin ceder a ningún tipo de chantaje. Tenemos las herramientas, pero debemos usarlas cuando sea necesario si esta amenaza continúa. Debemos adoptar sanciones y gravámenes a las grandes tecnológicas que incumplen nuestras normas y excluir a las empresas de los Estados Unidos de la contratación pública europea si continúan esta amenaza y este chantaje. Al mismo tiempo, debemos reforzar el mercado interior, impulsar la demanda interna y apoyar con un plan de ayudas directas a la industria y a las regiones más afectadas por esta guerra comercial. No olvidemos que el mundo es más grande que Trump. El 80 % de nuestras exportaciones se dirigen a otros mercados. Fortalezcamos los acuerdos con Canadá, Japón y México. Avancemos en Mercosur, India y con nuestros socios del África subsahariana. Diversificamos nuestra cadena de valor y hagamos de la Unión Europea una potencia líder a nivel mundial en comercio justo y sostenible. Pero hay una cuestión que es fundamental, y es que hay elementos que no son negociables: el Estado de Derecho no es negociable. La legislación europea no es negociable, porque somos un modelo único en el mundo. Eso nos ha hecho diferentes. Eso nos ha hecho fuertes. Y no podemos aceptar chantajes que vayan permitiendo que Europa cambie y modifique la legislación en aquello que tanto hemos avanzado: en el Estado del bienestar, en materia de igualdad, en materia también de cuestiones de sostenibilidad. La Unión Europea no puede ser rehén de cálculos electorales ni de tibiezas políticas. El reto al que nos enfrentamos es existencial. Se trata de decidir si queremos ser un actor global fuerte, soberano, con voz propia o si nos resignamos a ser meros espectadores sometidos a los caprichos de un demagogo multimillonario que desprecia todo lo que representa el proyecto europeo. Señorías, estamos ante un momento transformador. Este es el momento de levantar la voz, de defender con orgullo el proyecto europeo y de demostrar que, frente al caos, la Unión Europea es la esperanza de un orden justo, democrático y sostenible.",
         "Mr. President, dear Commissioner Šefčovič, Donald Trump and his worldview are a direct threat not only to international trade, but also to the values that underpin our democracies. His trade war against the European Union, with unjustified tariffs, threats to our industries and permanent blackmail, is the most obvious manifestation of an authoritarian economic nationalism that disregards international law and cooperation among equals. Trump and his far-right partners - inside and outside the European Union - do not believe in a world ordered by rules, but in the law of the strongest. In the face of their onslaught, we cannot and must not falter. We are here to firmly defend the European model, a model based on social justice, the welfare state and an economy that puts people at the center. The European Union must respond forcefully. Our response must be deployed on several fronts: protecting our workers, consumers and businesses; defending the rules-based international order, with a strong and reformed World Trade Organization; and negotiating with Trump from a position of firmness, without giving in to any kind of blackmail. We have the tools, but we must use them when necessary if this threat continues. We must adopt sanctions and levies on the big tech companies that breach our rules and exclude U.S. companies from European public procurement if this threat and blackmail continue. At the same time, we must strengthen the internal market, boost domestic demand and support industry and the regions most affected by this trade war with a direct aid plan. Let us not forget that the world is bigger than Trump. Eighty percent of our exports go to other markets. Let us strengthen agreements with Canada, Japan and Mexico. Let's move forward in Mercosur, India and with our partners in sub-Saharan Africa. Let us diversify our value chain and make the European Union a world leader in fair and sustainable trade. But there is one issue that is fundamental, and that is that there are elements that are non-negotiable: the rule of law is non-negotiable. European legislation is non-negotiable, because we are a unique model in the world. That has made us different. That has made us strong. And we cannot accept blackmail that would allow Europe to change and modify the legislation on what we have advanced so much: on the welfare state, on equality, and also on sustainability issues. The European Union cannot be held hostage to electoral calculations or political lukewarmness. The challenge we face is existential. It is a question of deciding whether we want to be a strong, sovereign global player with our own voice or whether we resign ourselves to being mere spectators subject to the whims of a billionaire demagogue who despises everything the European project stands for. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a transformative moment. This is the time to raise our voices, to proudly defend the European project and to demonstrate that, in the face of chaos, the European Union is the hope for a just, democratic and sustainable order."

         "in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, honourable Members, Commissioner, the EU-US trade and investment partnership is the most valuable in the world. I am convinced that we have a shared interest in protecting this mutually beneficial partnership and working together on common challenges. In this context, we deeply regret the recent increases of US tariffs applied on a very broad range of EU goods. We think that the imposition of additional tariffs, both universal and sectoral ones, is unjustified and arbitrary. These tariffs are damaging for prosperity. They negatively impact economic growth, foremost in the US but also globally, as confirmed by the IMF and WTO in their latest forecasts. Tariffs are taxes paid by businesses and ultimately by consumers. They will raise the cost of imports, disrupt supply chains and force companies to either absorb the cost or pass them on through higher prices, building up inflation. We welcome the 90-day suspension of a portion of the recently imposed US universal tariffs. At the same time, we are deeply concerned by many tariff increases remaining in place and possible new tariffs. More importantly, we are very concerned by the uncertainty that the US Administration announcements brought to the global economy. We understand that the US seeks to strengthen the resilience of its domestic industrial base and to enhance its economic security, but we believe that the announced tariffs are not the right way to achieve these goals. On behalf of the Council, I can assure you that we are united in our readiness to engage in a constructive dialogue with the US. Our priority is clearly to agree on a solution that is balanced and mutually beneficial, and that brings about more predictable trade and investment conditions. We believe that there is sufficient scope for delivering such a solution, but it is clear that significant joint efforts will still be needed to get there. We welcome recent concrete steps made by the Commission in the form of an offer of negotiations in selected areas. This step has full backing from the Council. As a clear sign of our good faith and our restraint, we have temporarily suspended the first set of countermeasures. It is also a sign of us not wishing to add to the already an unprecedented levels of economic uncertainty. But let me be clear: we will defend our legitimate interests and rights if we have to, and we will do so in a united, targeted and measured manner. There is a broad agreement in the Council on the need to work on possible further countermeasures, which would complement those already adopted. Our countermeasures can be fully reversed at any time if a negotiated solution is found. If, however, negotiation failed to deliver the desired outcome, we will consider taking further steps, keeping all options on the table, including a WTO complaint. We are working closely with the Commission. We are carefully assessing not only the effects of new US tariffs on EU exports, but also monitoring any unwanted indirect effects. We simply cannot absorb global overcapacity, we cannot accept dumping on our markets. Mr President, honourable Members, Commissioner, in these challenging times, we remain committed to the rules-based international order, as we continue to believe in an open and predictable global trading system that benefits all partners. We are engaging with our international partners both through multilateral fora as well as bilaterally. That is why the issue of possible trade diversion is firmly on our radar screen. In the Council, there is a broad agreement on the importance of deepening our existing partnerships around the world, as well as sealing new win-win deals. Finally, I want to underline that in times of growing uncertainty, the single market stands as a vital source of stability and resilience. The new situation we are facing gives an additional sense of urgency in implementing the new European competitiveness deal. We will therefore be stepping up our work in the Council towards lifting the remaining barriers to the proper functioning of our single market and boosting its potential.",

         "Mr President, honourable Members, dear Minister, dear Andre, first and foremost, I would like to appreciate that we have this very timely debate this morning, because it would allow us to have a deep look at the current state of our relationship between the European Union and the United States of America in the field of bilateral trade and economic cooperation. As was already highlighted by the Minister, we have built, together with the United States, over the years the largest bilateral and investment relationship in the world. Today, the European Union is by far the most important economic partner of the United States. Our trade in goods and services has doubled over the last decade, surpassing EUR 1.7 trillion in 2023, with EUR 851 billion of trade in goods and EUR 746 billion of trade in services. And for us, likewise, the US is our biggest trading partner. Our business communities have invested strongly on both sides. Total bilateral investment stocks reached EUR 5.3 trillion in 2022. Direct EU investment in the US is worth of EUR 2.7 trillion, making the EU companies the largest foreign investor in the United States of America. On top of it, I think it is very important to underline that European companies, EU firms directly employ 3.4 million people in the US, with millions more American workers, farmers and ranchers benefiting indirectly. Trade and investment between the European Union and the United States are therefore key building blocks of our shared prosperity, technology and research prowess, as well as remaining fundamental to our economic security. So it is evident that we have a mutual interest in nurturing and further developing our economic links and in making our partnership and relationship stronger. But as you know very well, honourable Members, our trade relations are currently facing strong headwinds. The US has unilaterally increased its import duties on EU goods in a significant manner. These import taxes are unjustified and cause economic harm on both sides of the Atlantic. They disrupt supply chains and affect global markets. They hurt EU and US companies, workers and farmers. They create uncertainty for transatlantic investment. They raise prices for consumers and businesses and increase inflation in the US. The US has temporarily decreased its universal additional tariffs from 20 % to 10 %. In response, we have shown significant goodwill by pausing our rebalancing measures on the steel and aluminium tariffs for 90 days. With this pause, we want to give space for negotiations. However, US tariffs still cover EUR 380 billion‑worth of EU exports to the US, corresponding to 70 % of our total exports, at rates between 10 % to 25 %. In addition, more US tariff actions could well be on their way, even though the US has acknowledged that the EU poses no problem and in fact shares many common challenges. On top of the ongoing investigation on lumber, the US has recently launched new Section 232 investigations based on national security grounds on: pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical ingredients; semiconductors, including semiconductor manufacturing equipment; critical minerals, also covering processed critical minerals and the derivative products; and, most recently, on tracks and track parts. This makes in total six additional ongoing investigations. If all these investigations lead to unjustified harmful tariffs, then another EUR 170 billion of EU exports to the US would be impacted. This means that in total around EUR 549 billion of EU exports to the US, meaning 97 % of the total would be subject to tariffs. In the terms of duties collected, this will be massive. In 2024, the US collected around EUR 7 billion in duties on EU exports. The projection is that the US might now collect as much as EUR 100 billion if the ongoing investigations result in tariffs. And, as you know, just yesterday we learnt about a new possible 100 % tariff on non‑US film production. So I believe that you would agree with me that the situation as such is not acceptable and we cannot afford to stay idle. And this brings me to our response. Honourable Members, we are not facing these headwinds on autopilot. As you know, President von der Leyen has entrusted me to engage with the US administration to try and find fair and mutually beneficial negotiated solutions and return to a constructive trade relationship. I am in constant contact with my US interlocutors for this purpose. In order to get these negotiations up and running, we have been scoping out the possibility to reduce barriers, not raise them, including by: proposing to agree on zero‑for‑zero tariffs for all industrial goods, including in strategic industrial sectors such as cars and car parts; jointly addressing global overcapacity in strategic industrial sectors such as steel and aluminium; jointly increasing the resilience of EU and US supply chains in sectors such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals; and securing a return to barrier‑free transatlantic trade and reviving our cooperation. So the EU has made clear that we are ready to discuss and we are ready to find mutually beneficial solutions respecting our interests and regulatory autonomy. We now need the US to show its readiness to make progress towards a fair and balanced solution. And I have already shared the approach with my US counterparts as a basis for further engagement. We are fully engaged in discussion with the US, as a negotiated solution remains our clear and preferred outcome. But if our talks with the US do not yield the necessary result, we will be ready for alternatives, with the aim of restoring a level playing field. Therefore, we are also using the 90‑day pause to continue our preparation for further rebalancing measures to counter the multitude of additional US tariffs on EU exports and ensure a level playing field in the longer term. And here I would like to underline that all options remain on the table. We are also preparing for litigation to preserve and reinforce the multilateral rules‑based trading system. At the same time, we are monitoring possible risks of trade diversion, by way of a Dedicated Import Surveillance Task Force, where the aim is to protect the EU market from possible surges of imports from other countries that are also hit by US tariffs and which seek alternative markets. The first results of this work are anticipated in mid‑May. The Commission stands ready, if necessary, to use all available tools in our trade defence instrument toolbox in a rapid manner to protect the EU single market, EU producers and EU consumers. We will also, honourable Members, continue diversifying our trade and investment ties with partners around the globe. This includes making the most of our extensive network of trade agreements with 76 countries across the globe, covering almost half of our trade, and doubling down on our efforts to finalise ongoing negotiations. Here, we know that countries around the world are looking at the EU as a trusted, reliable and predictable trading partner. In the current global environment, it is in everyone's interest to expand their network and strengthen their supply routes. For us, it is nothing less than a prerequisite for our competitiveness and our economic security that we find new markets for our exporters and new sources of imports, and it also helps double down on rules‑based trade, while we continue to push for proper multilateral governance with the WTO at its core. The US represents 13 % of global trade. It's a lot, but we must not forget about the remaining 87 %. And, therefore, work continues internally towards the adoption of signature of agreements with Mercosur and Mexico. These are perfect examples of deals we have made that can deliver hugely on our bid for diversification, to open new markets and further important geopolitical relations, while also securing key commitments on issues of climate change and sustainability. They offer significant opportunities for EU businesses and high potential for EU consumers. There is still work to be done to get them over the line. However, I count on the support of this House to ensure successful outcomes for the benefit of all. To conclude, Mr President, I also would like to inform the honourable Members that we are accelerating dramatically our ongoing negotiations with: India – we had very successful meetings just last week; Indonesia, where I had the important VTC yesterday; Philippines; Thailand; and Malaysia. As you know, we launched the free trade agreement talks with the United Arab Emirates, something which I believe could serve as a strong catalyst to advance our cooperation with the Gulf Cooperation Council countries with whom we are also negotiating strategic partnership agreements. So while we are pushing our FTA agenda forward, we are also making use of other, more flexible forms of engagement tailor‑made to our own needs and those of our respective partners, covering specific sectors and deepening our bilateral relations. Let me just conclude by highlighting that we are working very closely with Angola in implementing the Sustainable Investment Facilitation Agreement, which entered into force in 2024. And we are working closely with our partners on critical raw materials, but also on the digital trade agreements reached with South Africa earlier this year, and with Singapore, which I will be signing there on behalf of the EU this week. We are working very closely with South Africa also to advance our Clean Trade and Investment Partnership to strengthen our clean supply chains, which we hope to conclude by the end of 2025. My last, last point would be an appeal to all of us, and I would like to thank the Polish Presidency for excellent cooperation on making sure that our unity is unshakeable, that we act as one if it comes to these very important trade negotiations, because this is as vital as ever. And I would say that this is the time to act in unequivocal terms for the EU's interest and towards our goal of maintaining a strong and competitive economy as well as cohesive society.",

These are perfect examples of deals we have made that can deliver hugely on our bid for diversification, to open new markets and further important geopolitical relations, while also securing key commitments on issues of climate change and sustainability. They offer significant opportunities for EU businesses and high potential for EU consumers. There is still work to be done to get them over the line. However, I count on the support of this House to ensure successful outcomes for the benefit of all. To conclude, Mr President, I also would like to inform the honourable Members that we are accelerating dramatically our ongoing negotiations with: India – we had very successful meetings just last week; Indonesia, where I had the important VTC yesterday; Philippines; Thailand; and Malaysia. As you know, we launched the free trade agreement talks with the United Arab Emirates, something which I believe could serve as a strong catalyst to advance our cooperation with the Gulf Cooperation Council countries with whom we are also negotiating strategic partnership agreements. So while we are pushing our FTA agenda forward, we are also making use of other, more flexible forms of engagement tailor‑made to our own needs and those of our respective partners, covering specific sectors and deepening our bilateral relations. Let me just conclude by highlighting that we are working very closely with Angola in implementing the Sustainable Investment Facilitation Agreement, which entered into force in 2024. And we are working closely with our partners on critical raw materials, but also on the digital trade agreements reached with South Africa earlier this year, and with Singapore, which I will be signing there on behalf of the EU this week. We are working very closely with South Africa also to advance our Clean Trade and Investment Partnership to strengthen our clean supply chains, which we hope to conclude by the end of 2025. My last, last point would be an appeal to all of us, and I would like to thank the Polish Presidency for excellent cooperation on making sure that our unity is unshakeable, that we act as one if it comes to these very important trade negotiations, because this is as vital as ever. And I would say that this is the time to act in unequivocal terms for the EU's interest and towards our goal of maintaining a strong and competitive economy as well as cohesive society.",

         "Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, colleagues, we find ourselves at a historic crossroads, not just in terms of economic policy, but also in the broader context of global geopolitics. Trade tension, of course, is nothing new. But today, in an era of deep globalisation and tightly interlinked supply chains, the consequences are more far-reaching than ever. We have seen this clearly in the past months, when Trump's erratic trade measures triggered volatility across financial markets. The EU's response, especially in the face of the unjustified trade measures from a long-standing ally, will be remembered. Our approach must strike a careful balance, preserving the principle of trust, respect and transatlantic cooperation, while also shielding European citizens and industries from economic harm. I therefore call on the Commission to act decisively within their 90-day retaliatory pause. The current pause from the Trump administration is de facto a 25 % tariff on EU steel, aluminium and automobiles and a 10 % tariff on almost all other goods. The Commission's decision to hold off on immediate retaliation is wise; de-escalation creates a space for dialogue. But let us be clear: inaction cannot become our policy. Within these 90 days, we must prepare a strong and measured and unified response. At the same time, we must do three things to strategically position Europe: strengthen the single market, negotiate and ratify more free trade agreements, not least Mercosur and the one with Mexico, and reassert leadership within WTO, because we need the rules-based international system when there is unpredictability in the world.",

         "Señor presidente, querido comisario Šefčovič, Donald Trump y su visión del mundo son una amenaza directa no solo para el comercio internacional, sino también para los valores que sustentan nuestras democracias. Su guerra comercial contra la Unión Europea, con aranceles injustificados, amenazas a nuestras industrias y chantajes permanentes, es la manifestación más evidente de un nacionalismo económico autoritario que desprecia el derecho internacional y la cooperación entre iguales. Trump y sus socios de extrema derecha —dentro y fuera de la Unión Europea— no creen en un mundo ordenado por normas, sino en la ley del más fuerte. Frente a su embestida, no podemos ni debemos titubear. Estamos aquí para defender con firmeza el modelo europeo, un modelo basado en la justicia social, en el Estado del bienestar y en una economía que pone en el centro a las personas. La Unión Europea debe responder con contundencia. Nuestra respuesta debe desplegarse en varios frentes: la protección de nuestros trabajadores, consumidores y empresas; la defensa del orden internacional basado en reglas, con una Organización Mundial del Comercio fuerte y reformada; y la negociación frente a Trump desde una posición de firmeza, sin ceder a ningún tipo de chantaje. Tenemos las herramientas, pero debemos usarlas cuando sea necesario si esta amenaza continúa. Debemos adoptar sanciones y gravámenes a las grandes tecnológicas que incumplen nuestras normas y excluir a las empresas de los Estados Unidos de la contratación pública europea si continúan esta amenaza y este chantaje. Al mismo tiempo, debemos reforzar el mercado interior, impulsar la demanda interna y apoyar con un plan de ayudas directas a la industria y a las regiones más afectadas por esta guerra comercial. No olvidemos que el mundo es más grande que Trump. El 80 % de nuestras exportaciones se dirigen a otros mercados. Fortalezcamos los acuerdos con Canadá, Japón y México. Avancemos en Mercosur, India y con nuestros socios del África subsahariana. Diversificamos nuestra cadena de valor y hagamos de la Unión Europea una potencia líder a nivel mundial en comercio justo y sostenible. Pero hay una cuestión que es fundamental, y es que hay elementos que no son negociables: el Estado de Derecho no es negociable. La legislación europea no es negociable, porque somos un modelo único en el mundo. Eso nos ha hecho diferentes. Eso nos ha hecho fuertes. Y no podemos aceptar chantajes que vayan permitiendo que Europa cambie y modifique la legislación en aquello que tanto hemos avanzado: en el Estado del bienestar, en materia de igualdad, en materia también de cuestiones de sostenibilidad. La Unión Europea no puede ser rehén de cálculos electorales ni de tibiezas políticas. El reto al que nos enfrentamos es existencial. Se trata de decidir si queremos ser un actor global fuerte, soberano, con voz propia o si nos resignamos a ser meros espectadores sometidos a los caprichos de un demagogo multimillonario que desprecia todo lo que representa el proyecto europeo. Señorías, estamos ante un momento transformador. Este es el momento de levantar la voz, de defender con orgullo el proyecto europeo y de demostrar que, frente al caos, la Unión Europea es la esperanza de un orden justo, democrático y sostenible.",
         "Mr. President, dear Commissioner Šefčovič, Donald Trump and his worldview are a direct threat not only to international trade, but also to the values that underpin our democracies. His trade war against the European Union, with unjustified tariffs, threats to our industries and permanent blackmail, is the most obvious manifestation of an authoritarian economic nationalism that disregards international law and cooperation among equals. Trump and his far-right partners - inside and outside the European Union - do not believe in a world ordered by rules, but in the law of the strongest. In the face of their onslaught, we cannot and must not falter. We are here to firmly defend the European model, a model based on social justice, the welfare state and an economy that puts people at the center. The European Union must respond forcefully. Our response must be deployed on several fronts: protecting our workers, consumers and businesses; defending the rules-based international order, with a strong and reformed World Trade Organization; and negotiating with Trump from a position of firmness, without giving in to any kind of blackmail. We have the tools, but we must use them when necessary if this threat continues. We must adopt sanctions and levies on the big tech companies that breach our rules and exclude U.S. companies from European public procurement if this threat and blackmail continue. At the same time, we must strengthen the internal market, boost domestic demand and support industry and the regions most affected by this trade war with a direct aid plan. Let us not forget that the world is bigger than Trump. Eighty percent of our exports go to other markets. Let us strengthen agreements with Canada, Japan and Mexico. Let's move forward in Mercosur, India and with our partners in sub-Saharan Africa. Let us diversify our value chain and make the European Union a world leader in fair and sustainable trade. But there is one issue that is fundamental, and that is that there are elements that are non-negotiable: the rule of law is non-negotiable. European legislation is non-negotiable, because we are a unique model in the world. That has made us different. That has made us strong. And we cannot accept blackmail that would allow Europe to change and modify the legislation on what we have advanced so much: on the welfare state, on equality, and also on sustainability issues. The European Union cannot be held hostage to electoral calculations or political lukewarmness. The challenge we face is existential. It is a question of deciding whether we want to be a strong, sovereign global player with our own voice or whether we resign ourselves to being mere spectators subject to the whims of a billionaire demagogue who despises everything the European project stands for. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a transformative moment. This is the time to raise our voices, to proudly defend the European project and to demonstrate that, in the face of chaos, the European Union is the hope for a just, democratic and sustainable order.",

         "Monsieur le Président, Monsieur le Commissaire, rien n'a été anticipé, et pourtant l'Europe semble découvrir ce qui était annoncé depuis bien longtemps: conformément à son projet, Donald Trump utilise les droits de douane comme une arme pour faire plier aussi bien ses partenaires que ses concurrents. En frappant sans distinction presque tous les secteurs et tous les États, le président américain crée des incertitudes et des fragilités supplémentaires pour nos entrepreneurs. L'heure n'est cependant pas à la déploration; l'heure est à la riposte, à la réponse et à la défense de nos intérêts économiques. À court terme, il est dans notre bon droit de riposter par des droits de douane gradués, qui seront un moyen de pression pour négocier et obtenir un retour à la normale. L'Europe est un marché de 450 millions de consommateurs et il serait incompréhensible qu'elle reste les bras ballants. La véritable riposte consiste en une rupture claire avec au moins trois décennies d'errance, une rupture avec les choix de la Commission européenne. Alors que nous sommes entrés dans l'ère des affrontements, l'Europe ne peut plus être la seule puissance à respecter des règles internationales de bienséance que plus personne n'applique. Face à la concurrence féroce des puissances, et notamment des puissances émergentes, dans l'adversité d'un monde plus dur et plus incertain, je vous en conjure, réveillez-vous! Réveillez-vous ou bien notre agriculture disparaîtra. Réveillez-vous, ou bien notre industrie automobile mettra la clé sous la porte, notre métallurgie subira une saignée plus terrible encore – je pense évidemment ici aux salariés d'ArcelorMittal, condamnés par une inaction coupable et par des règles absurdes. Réveillez-vous en bâtissant l'autonomie stratégique des nations et du continent, avec l'objectif de dépendre le moins possible de l'extérieur pour nos besoins vitaux, à commencer par celui de notre défense. Toutes les règles contraignantes du pacte vert inspirées par l'écologie punitive doivent être levées pour permettre à nos entreprises et à nos agriculteurs, notamment, de produire sans entraves. Les règles du marché européen de l'électricité doivent être réformées et le nucléaire doit prendre toute sa place dans notre bouquet énergétique. Une véritable préférence nationale et européenne dans les commandes publiques doit s'appliquer, notamment en matière de défense, mais pas uniquement. Réveillez-vous! Réveillez-vous et sortez de la naïveté, ou bien l'Europe et toutes les nations qui la composent sortiront de l'histoire.",
         "Mr. President, Commissioner, nothing has been anticipated, and yet Europe seems to be discovering what was announced a long time ago: in line with his plans, Donald Trump is using tariffs as a weapon to bend his partners and competitors alike. By striking indiscriminately at almost all sectors and all states, the American president is creating additional uncertainties and fragilities for our entrepreneurs. But this is no time for lament; it's time to fight back, to respond and to defend our economic interests. In the short term, we have every right to retaliate with graduated tariffs, as a means of pressure to negotiate a return to normality. Europe is a market of 450 million consumers, and it would be incomprehensible for it to stand idly by. The real response is a clear break with at least three decades of wandering, a break with the choices made by the European Commission. At a time when we have entered an era of confrontation, Europe can no longer be the only power to respect international rules of propriety that nobody applies any more. Faced with fierce competition from other powers, particularly emerging powers, in the adversity of a tougher and more uncertain world, I implore you to wake up! Wake up, or our agriculture will disappear. Wake up, or our automotive industry will close down, our metallurgy will suffer an even more terrible loss - I'm obviously thinking here of the employees of ArcelorMittal, condemned by culpable inaction and absurd rules. Wake up and build the strategic autonomy of nations and the continent, with the aim of depending as little as possible on the outside world for our vital needs, starting with our own defense. All the restrictive rules of the green pact, inspired by punitive ecology, must be lifted to allow our companies and farmers, in particular, to produce without hindrance. The rules of the European electricity market must be reformed, and nuclear power must take its rightful place in our energy mix. Genuine national and European preference in public procurement must be applied, particularly in defense, but not only. Wake up! Wake up and get over your naiveté, or Europe and all its constituent nations will go down in history.",

         "Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, noi conservatori crediamo nel libero mercato che favorisce allo stesso tempo i consumatori e i produttori, quelli naturalmente più capaci, con più talento. Ma dobbiamo ammettere che la politica dei dazi è stata anche una politica europea, che non si è rivolta soltanto verso chi viola ogni giorno la libera concorrenza, come la Cina, ma anche nei confronti di alleati preziosi come i cittadini americani. Faccio un solo esempio: fino a poche settimane fa gli Stati Uniti ponevano un dazio del 2,5 % sulle auto europee. L'Unione europea poneva un dazio del 10 % sulle auto americane. Da qui bisogna partire per un accordo con gli Stati Uniti di libero scambio con zero dazi da ambo le parti. È ciò di cui ha discusso Meloni con Trump a Washington dentro un quadro politico generale in cui va preservata l'unità dell'Occidente. Il riequilibrio della bilancia commerciale con gli Stati Uniti non è solo un fatto economico, è anche politico. Lo scandalo del gas liquido dalla Russia è emblematico di una certa ipocrisia europea e soltanto oggi il commissario Jørgensen sembra intenzionato ad occuparsene. Sapete quali sono le nazioni che hanno più arricchito Putin negli ultimi anni con l'acquisto di GNL? Beh, non è l'Ungheria di Orban ma è la Francia di Macron, con un incremento dell'81 % tra il 2024 e il 2023. Ed è la Spagna green di Sánchez che con il 38 % ha nella Russia il suo maggiore fornitore di gas. Ecco un'altra cosa giusta da fare: rimuovere i dazi che l'Unione europea ha inflitto a se stessa con il Green Deal e così rilanciare la sua competitività. Questa è la strada che dobbiamo percorrere; non certo quella che va verso regimi illiberali come la Cina o la Corea del Nord.",
         "Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, we conservatives believe in the free market, which favors at the same time consumers and producers, those who are naturally more capable, more talented. But we must admit that the policy of tariffs has also been a European policy, which has not only been aimed at those who violate free competition every day, such as China, but also at valuable allies such as American citizens. I give just one example: until a few weeks ago, the United States was placing a 2.5 percent duty on European cars. The European Union was placing a 10 percent duty on American cars. This is where we need to start for a free trade agreement with the United States with zero tariffs on both sides. This is what Meloni discussed with Trump in Washington within an overall political framework in which the unity of the West must be preserved. Rebalancing the trade balance with the United States is not only an economic matter, it is also political. The liquid gas scandal from Russia is emblematic of a certain European hypocrisy, and only today Commissioner Jørgensen seems willing to deal with it. Do you know which nations have enriched Putin the most in recent years by buying LNG? Well, it is not Orban's Hungary, but it is Macron's France, with an 81 percent increase between 2024 and 2023. And it is Sánchez's green Spain, which with 38 percent has Russia as its largest gas supplier. Here is another right thing to do: remove the tariffs that the European Union has inflicted on itself with the Green Deal and thus boost its competitiveness. This is the path we must take; certainly not the one that goes to illiberal regimes like China or North Korea.",

         "Monsieur le Président, Monsieur le Vice-Président, Monsieur le Ministre, chers collègues, «le vieux monde se meurt, le nouveau tarde à apparaître et dans ce clair-obscur surgissent les monstres»: cette citation d'Antonio Gramsci est la parfaite métaphore du défi posé par la guerre commerciale de Donald Trump. Cette guerre commerciale interroge l'identité même de l'Union européenne. Elle est, au-delà du péril immense qu'elle représente pour nos économies, un défi politique, une confrontation entre deux modèles, le modèle promu par cette nouvelle administration américaine – protectionnisme, brutalité, populisme – et notre modèle européen – liberté, force du droit, démocratie. Le «Make America great again» est une attaque frontale contre le multilatéralisme. C'est une attaque frontale contre une Europe dans laquelle 27 pays jouent le jeu de la coopération. C'est une attaque frontale contre ce que nous avons construit ensemble au lendemain de la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Oui, chers collègues, le commerce mondial régulé est un outil de paix durable, le plus puissant que nous ayons jamais connu. Pourtant, Donald Trump a décidé de lancer une guerre commerciale à la terre entière; à la terre entière, hormis la Russie, la Biélorussie et la Corée du Nord. Alors, je voudrais dire trois choses au président américain: premièrement, la guerre commerciale ne profite à personne et en aucun cas aux consommateurs américains qui sont les premiers à en payer le prix. Deuxièmement, l'Europe sera toujours un partenaire commercial juste et fiable, dans le respect des règles internationales. Troisièmement, s'il faut jouer le rapport de force, alors nous y sommes prêts. Vous l'avez rappelé, Monsieur le Vice-Président, nous avons tous les outils de défense commerciale pour protéger nos concitoyens et nos entreprises. C'est notre position. Sans jamais fermer la porte à la négociation, la Commission européenne doit être prête à se saisir de ces instruments. Chers collègues, la bataille culturelle imposée par Donald Trump oblige chacun à se positionner, y compris dans cet hémicycle. Certains d'entre vous étaient à Washington le soir même de son élection. Beaucoup ont appelé à un trumpisme, à la française ou à l'européenne. Certains, d'ailleurs, sont bien embarrassés aujourd'hui, comme c'est le cas des orateurs qui m'ont précédée. Ce sont les mêmes qui rêvent d'un repli sur les frontières nationales et d'un retour au protectionnisme économique. Je veux vous dire: ouvrez les yeux, cela ne marche pas! Voyez par vous-mêmes que cela ne peut pas marcher. Ce que nous défendons ici, c'est un commerce mondial régulé. Ce sont des accords de commerce conclus sur des bases de réciprocité qui ne mettent pas en péril nos agriculteurs ou nos industries, des accords de commerce qui permettent au contraire de diversifier nos approvisionnements en matières premières ou nos débouchés économiques. C'est la garantie de notre prospérité pour les années qui viennent. Dans cette période, chers collègues, l'Europe est tout sauf faible. Nous avons un marché de 450 millions d'Européens, attractif pour de nombreux pays qui veulent renforcer leurs relations avec nous. Nous avons un cadre législatif et réglementaire qui offre une visibilité rassurante pour de nombreux investisseurs. Alors ne laissons pas les monstres surgir du clair-obscur. Ne laissons pas l'Europe dévier de son chemin. Construisons les bases d'un monde nouveau où l'Union européenne répond au défi de sa souveraineté.",
         "Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice-Chairman, Mr. Minister, ladies and gentlemen, \"the old world is dying, the new is slow in appearing, and in this chiaroscuro monsters arise\": this quotation from Antonio Gramsci is the perfect metaphor for the challenge posed by Donald Trump's trade war. This trade war calls into question the very identity of the European Union. Beyond the immense peril it represents for our economies, it is a political challenge, a confrontation between two models, the model promoted by this new American administration - protectionism, brutality, populism - and our European model - freedom, the rule of law, democracy. Make America great again\" is a frontal attack on multilateralism. It is a frontal attack on a Europe in which 27 countries play the game of cooperation. It is a frontal attack on what we built together in the aftermath of the Second World War. Yes, dear colleagues, regulated world trade is a tool for lasting peace, the most powerful we have ever known. Yet Donald Trump has decided to launch a trade war against the whole world; the whole world, apart from Russia, Belarus and North Korea. So I'd like to say three things to the American president: firstly, the trade war benefits nobody, and certainly not American consumers, who are the first to pay the price. Secondly, Europe will always be a fair and reliable trading partner, in compliance with international rules. Thirdly, if we have to use our strength, then we're ready to do so. As you pointed out, Mr. Vice-President, we have all the trade defense tools we need to protect our fellow citizens and our businesses. That's our position. Without ever closing the door to negotiation, the European Commission must be ready to seize these instruments. Ladies and gentlemen, the cultural battle imposed by Donald Trump is forcing everyone to take a stand, including in this Chamber. Some of you were in Washington on the very evening of his election. Many of you called for Trumpism, French-style or European-style. Some, moreover, are quite embarrassed today, as are the speakers who preceded me. These are the same people who dream of a retreat to national borders and a return to economic protectionism. I want to say to you: open your eyes, it doesn't work! See for yourselves that it can't work. What we're defending here is regulated world trade. These are trade agreements concluded on the basis of reciprocity that do not jeopardize our farmers or our industries, trade agreements that, on the contrary, enable us to diversify our supplies of raw materials or our economic outlets. This is the guarantee of our prosperity in the years to come. In these times, dear colleagues, Europe is anything but weak. We have a market of 450 million Europeans, attractive to many countries that want to strengthen their relations with us. We have a legislative and regulatory framework that offers reassuring visibility for many investors. So let's not let monsters emerge from the shadows. Let's not let Europe go off course. Let's build the foundations of a new world in which the European Union meets the challenge of its sovereignty.",

Trump is playing a stupid but dangerous game. If the current negotiations do not work – and the Commissioner already said it – the EU has to show its strength and retaliate firmly. We have the instruments to do so. It comes down to political will and leadership. We should not back down to a bully.

         "Herr Präsident! Donald Trump hat es geschafft, in den ersten hundert Tagen seiner Präsidentschaft die internationalen Handelsbeziehungen komplett zu chaotisieren. Die Folgen für Wirtschaft und die Bevölkerung sind bereits absehbar. Die Wirtschaftsleistung wird zurückgehen, und gleichzeitig werden sich die Preise verteuern. Die Zeche dafür werden zuallererst wieder die arbeitende Bevölkerung zahlen und diejenigen, die sowieso wenig Geld in der Tasche haben. Diese Politik ist kein Zufall. Der Rechtspopulist Donald Trump versucht gezielt, die Interessen seiner Wirtschaftskumpels, nämlich der US‑Rüstungsindustrie, der US‑Energieriesen und der US‑Big‑Tech‑Unternehmen durchzusetzen. Aber die Europäische Kommission scheint das noch gar nicht wirklich begriffen zu haben. Herr Kommissar, wir befinden uns in einem globalen Handelskrieg, und dabei wird Handelspolitik als eine Waffe eingesetzt, um wirtschaftliche Interessen durchzusetzen und international Einflusssphären abzustecken. Dem muss europäische Politik mit einer klaren Strategie begegnen, die Wirtschaft und Jobs hier in der Europäischen Union schützt, und das geht nur mit massiven Investitionen in unsere Industrie. Das geht nur mit strategischer Unabhängigkeit der Europäischen Union. Heute wissen auch Sie, Herr Kommissar, dass die anfängliche Kopf‑in‑den‑Sand‑Strategie der Kommission à la „Es wird schon nicht so schlimm werden” politische Realitätsverweigerung war. Jetzt wollen Sie verhandeln, einen Deal auch im Sinne von Donald Trump abschließen, und wenn das nicht klappen sollte, dann soll es angeblich harte Gegenmaßnahmen geben. Von Angeboten Ihrerseits höre ich viel, die gibt es reichlich. Jetzt soll sogar noch mehr US‑Fracking-Gas gekauft werden – anstatt die europäische Energieunabhängigkeit voranzutreiben und so viele Jobs zu schaffen, wird eine neue Abhängigkeit von fossilen Energieträgern geschaffen. Das ist ökonomisch, sozial und ökologisch grundfalsch. Aber von dem Druck auf die US‑Regierung ist noch nichts zu sehen. Wo bleibt denn die Einführung des Instruments gegen Zwangsmaßnahmen? Wo bleibt denn die harte Regulierung der großen Big‑Tech‑Unternehmen? Wo bleibt die Einführung einer europäischen Digitalsteuer? Da machen Sie die Augen zu, da legen Sie die Hände hinter dem Rücken zusammen. Wollen Sie denn auf diese Art und Weise den reichsten Unternehmen und Menschen wie Elon Musk noch mehr Geld und vor allem auch unsere privaten Daten in den Rachen werfen? Es ist jetzt an der Zeit, mit Partnern wie Kanada, Mexiko, Japan, Südkorea, aber auch mit China an einer Handelsordnung zu wirken, die regelbasiert ist, auf fairem Handel statt auf entfesseltem Freihandel basiert. Und alles, was der EU‑Kommission da einzufallen scheint, sind Rohstoffabkommen wie das mit Ruanda, das maßgeblich zu einer Verschärfung des Krieges im Kongo beiträgt, oder digitale Kooperationsabkommen wie das mit Singapur, das unsere Datensicherheit unterläuft, oder aber klassische Freihandelsabkommen wie mit Mercosur, denen die Europäer schon seit TTIP die Rote Karte gezeigt haben, weil sie schlecht für soziale Standards, Umwelt und Landwirtschaft sind. Ihre Antwort auf Trump dient einzig und allein den US‑Oligarchen und den europäischen Oligarchen. Wir brauchen eine Antwort, die der Mehrheit der Bevölkerung und der Demokratie dient.",
         "Mr President, Donald Trump has managed to completely chaotize international trade relations in the first hundred days of his presidency. The consequences for the economy and the population are already foreseeable. Economic output will fall and prices will rise at the same time. The bill for this will be paid first and foremost by the working population and those who already have little money in their pockets. This policy is no coincidence. The right-wing populist Donald Trump is deliberately trying to push through the interests of his economic cronies, namely the US arms industry, US energy giants and US big tech companies. But the European Commission doesn't really seem to have grasped this yet. Commissioner, we are in a global trade war, and trade policy is being used as a weapon to assert economic interests and stake out spheres of influence internationally. European policy must counter this with a clear strategy that protects the economy and jobs here in the European Union, and that is only possible with massive investment in our industry. This can only be achieved if the European Union is strategically independent. Today, Commissioner, you also know that the Commission's initial head-in-the-sand strategy of \"it won't be so bad\" was a political denial of reality. Now you want to negotiate, conclude a deal in the spirit of Donald Trump, and if that doesn't work, there are supposed to be tough countermeasures. I hear a lot about offers on your part, there are plenty of them. Now even more US fracking gas is to be bought - instead of driving forward European energy independence and creating so many jobs, a new dependency on fossil fuels is being created. This is economically, socially and ecologically fundamentally wrong. But there is still no sign of any pressure on the US government. Where is the introduction of the instrument against coercive measures? Where is the tough regulation of the big tech companies? Where is the introduction of a European digital tax? You are closing your eyes and putting your hands behind your back. Do you want to throw even more money and, above all, our private data down the throats of the richest companies and people like Elon Musk in this way? It is now time to work with partners such as Canada, Mexico, Japan, South Korea and China on a trade order that is rules-based and based on fair trade instead of unbridled free trade. And all the EU Commission seems to be able to come up with are commodity agreements such as the one with Rwanda, which contributes significantly to an intensification of the war in the Congo, or digital cooperation agreements such as the one with Singapore, which undermines our data security, or classic free trade agreements such as the one with Mercosur, which Europeans have already shown the red card to since TTIP because they are bad for social standards, the environment and agriculture. Their response to Trump serves only the US oligarchs and the European oligarchs. We need a response that serves the majority of the population and democracy.",

         "Fraktion. – Herr Präsident, meine sehr geehrten Damen und Herren! Wer nach außen abhängig ist, wird nach außen handlungsunfähig. Und genau das ist eingetreten – nicht zufällig, sondern weil die Altparteien unsere militärische Sicherheit über Jahrzehnte den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika überlassen haben. Das war bequem, aber es war auch naiv. Heute sehen wir das Ergebnis: Europa ist erpressbar geworden. Die Regierung unter Donald Trump versucht, Europa zum Kauf von immer mehr US‑Fracking‑Gas zu nötigen. Die Folge: noch höhere Energiepreise zulasten unserer Industrie, unserer Familien und unseres Wohlstandes. Und es rächt sich auch das überhebliche Gehabe, mit dem viele in der europäischen Politik über Jahre hinweg auf Donald Trump herabgesehen haben. Die öffentlichen Angriffe haben dazu geführt, dass heute weder in Brüssel noch in Berlin oder Paris vertrauensvolle Gesprächskanäle zur US‑Regierung bestehen. Ein Glück, dass es in Europa auch andere Stimmen gibt – Viktor Orbán, Georgia Meloni und viele patriotische Regierungen –, die den Kontakt gepflegt haben. Doch es geht nicht nur um Amerika. Auch Handelsalternativen wurden fahrlässig zerstört durch Besserwisserei gegenüber China, gegenüber Indien und weiten Teilen Afrikas. Statt Partnerschaft gab es Belehrungen über Demokratie, über Menschenrechte, über Klima. Und heute? Heute fehlen uns genau diese Partner als Alternativen, die wir bräuchten, um in Verhandlungen mit den USA Stärke zeigen zu können. Denn wer keine Alternativen hat, hat auch keine Verhandlungsmacht. Das europäische Establishment hat unseren Kontinent durch Arroganz isoliert. Doch wer im 21. Jahrhundert bestehen will, braucht Kooperation statt Konfrontation, Partnerschaften, nicht Feindbilder. Und noch etwas: Heute zeigt sich, wie wichtig der europäische Binnenmarkt ist. Zu diesem haben wir uns als AfD immer bekannt. Unser Motto lautet: Deutschland zuerst, aber nicht Deutschland allein. Europa muss in zentralen Handelsfragen mit einer Stimme sprechen. Aber das setzt auch eines voraus, nämlich: Das europäische Establishment muss die Spaltung nach innen beenden. Erkennen Sie das Wahlergebnis in Rumänien an! Hören Sie auf, sich aus Brüssel heraus in die inneren Angelegenheiten Ungarns einzumischen, und stoppen Sie die Verfolgung der AfD in Deutschland!",
         "Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. Those who are dependent on the outside become incapable of acting on the outside. And that is exactly what has happened - not by chance, but because the old parties left our military security to the United States of America for decades. That was convenient, but it was also naive. Today we see the result: Europe has become vulnerable to blackmail. The government under Donald Trump is trying to force Europe to buy more and more US fracking gas. The result: even higher energy prices at the expense of our industry, our families and our prosperity. And the arrogant attitude with which many in European politics have looked down on Donald Trump over the years is also taking its revenge. The public attacks have meant that there are no trustworthy channels of communication with the US government today, neither in Brussels nor in Berlin or Paris. Fortunately, there are other voices in Europe - Viktor Orbán, Georgia Meloni and many patriotic governments - that have maintained contact. But it's not just about America. Trade alternatives have also been negligently destroyed by know-it-all attitudes towards China, India and large parts of Africa. Instead of partnership, there were lectures on democracy, human rights and the climate. And today? Today, we lack precisely these partners as alternatives that we need in order to show strength in negotiations with the USA. Because if you have no alternatives, you have no negotiating power. The European establishment has isolated our continent through arrogance. But if you want to survive in the 21st century, you need cooperation instead of confrontation, partnerships, not enemy stereotypes. And one more thing: today it is clear how important the European single market is. As the AfD, we have always been committed to this. Our motto is: Germany first, but not Germany alone. Europe must speak with one voice on key trade issues. But this also requires one thing: the European establishment must end the internal division. Recognize the election result in Romania! Stop interfering in Hungary's internal affairs from Brussels and stop the persecution of the AfD in Germany!",

No es cierto que vivamos en un régimen internacional de libre comercio que está en peligro. Los aranceles, las cuotas a la importación y las barreras regulatorias son la regla general. China subió los aranceles al porcino hace unos meses y ustedes no dijeron ni pío. Es Bruselas la que lleva décadas levantando barreras y cargas contra nuestros productores en nombre de la Pachamama. Competimos con las manos atadas mientras China, Turquía y Marruecos golpean con los dos puños. Y ustedes, socialistas y populares, son los responsables. Le niegan agua a Almería o Murcia, pero financian obras hídricas en Marruecos. Ustedes expropian cientos de miles de olivos en España para poner placas solares, ustedes prohíben a la industria vender coches con motores de combustión en 2035. Ustedes montaron un negocio especulativo de derechos de emisión de CO2 que ahoga a nuestras industrias por razones climáticas y un mecanismo de ajuste en frontera que es una barrera no arancelaria. Ustedes se meten en los consejos de administración debajo de las mesas a mirar el sexo de los administradores. Ustedes solo piensan en subir impuestos para pagar la juerga de las élites y se han gastado nuestro dinero en renovables chinas. Y en España ya no tenemos luz. Para ustedes, el libre comercio es rendirse con China. Para ustedes, libre comercio son esos acuerdos con países que no cumplen los estándares que se exigen a los nuestros. Por supuesto que rechazamos cualquier arancel a nuestros productores, pero primero y por encima de todo, rechazamos su Agenda 2030, su Pacto Verde y su hipocresía de fanáticos climáticos.",

It is not true that we live in an endangered international free trade regime. Tariffs, import quotas and regulatory barriers are the general rule. China raised tariffs on pork a few months ago and you didn't say a peep. It is Brussels that has been raising barriers and burdens against our producers for decades in the name of Pachamama. We compete with our hands tied while China, Turkey and Morocco strike with both fists. And you, socialists and popular, are responsible. You deny water to Almeria or Murcia, but you finance water works in Morocco. You expropriate hundreds of thousands of olive trees in Spain to put solar panels, you prohibit the industry to sell cars with combustion engines in 2035. You set up a speculative business of CO2 emission rights that stifles our industries for climate reasons and a border adjustment mechanism that is a non-tariff barrier. You go under the board of directors' tables to look at the sex of the administrators. You only think about raising taxes to pay for the revelry of the elites and you have spent our money on Chinese renewables. And in Spain we no longer have electricity. For you, free trade means giving in to China. For you, free trade is those agreements with countries that do not meet the standards required of ours.

We are ready to fight back. When Trump fails and Putin threatens Europe, we need to stick together. A stronger EU defending the interests of Europe, Sweden and Ukraine is what we need. When the US even raises tariffs against Ukraine, we will work to get them removed. When the US tries to rule by dividing the EU, we should strengthen the single market and trade more with each other.

Es macht mir große Sorgen, dass Trumps Zollkrieg Jobs vernichtet, der Wirtschaft schadet, die Preise steigen lässt, und das vor allem in den USA. Und es macht mir extrem große Sorgen, dass in den USA gerade ein rechtsnationaler powergrab stattfindet, der Stück für Stück Demokratie und Rechtsstaatlichkeit abschafft. Und es ist so wichtig, dass die EU in diesem Chaos geschlossen agiert. Als größter Markt der Welt haben wir eine riesige Macht, und die sollten wir nicht kleinreden. Lassen wir uns von der aktuellen Zollpause nicht blenden. Viele von Trumps Zöllen, die sind bereits in Kraft, und deswegen müssen wir jetzt gezielte Gegenmaßnahmen auf den Weg bringen, wenn er die aktuellen Zölle nicht zurücknimmt. Dazu gehört auch eine Besteuerung der großen Digitalkonzerne. Klar muss die Kommission gleichzeitig weiter versuchen, zu verhandeln. Aber auf keinen Fall dürfen wir unsere Standards senken und unsere europäischen Gesetze aufweichen. Das gilt für die Regulierung von Techgiganten genauso wie für die Landwirtschaftsimporte und für die Regeln zu Methan. Neue LNG-Importe – ich weiß nicht, ob das eine gute Idee ist. Der zu erwartenden massiven Umlenkung aus China müssen wir mit robusten Schutzmaßnahmen begegnen. Ja, wir müssen die Handelspartner diversifizieren. Aber für mich heißt das vor allen Dingen, den Binnenmarkt zu stärken, die Nachfrage hier zu stärken. Ich sage ganz klar: Trumps Zollpolitik kann nicht die Ausrede dafür sein, dass wir bei neuen Handelsabkommen unsere Standards über Bord werfen und der weiteren Auslagerung von Industrieproduktion Tür und Tor öffnen. Bei aller Kritik an Trump dürfen wir nicht vergessen, dass sich in den USA in beiden Lagern eine riesige Unzufriedenheit über die Globalisierung Bahn bricht. Und das darf in Europa nicht passieren.",

I am very concerned that Trump's tariff war is destroying jobs, damaging the economy and causing prices to rise, especially in the USA. And I am extremely concerned that a right-wing nationalist power grab is currently taking place in the USA, which is gradually abolishing democracy and the rule of law. And it is so important that the EU acts as one in this chaos. As the largest market in the world, we have enormous power and we should not downplay it. Let's not be blinded by the current tariff pause. Many of Trump's tariffs are already in force, which is why we must now initiate targeted countermeasures if he does not withdraw the current tariffs. This also includes taxing the big digital companies. Of course, the Commission must continue to try to negotiate at the same time. But under no circumstances should we lower our standards and soften our European laws. This applies to the regulation of tech giants as well as to agricultural imports and the rules on methane. New LNG imports - I don't know if that's a good idea. We must counter the expected massive diversion from China with robust protective measures. Yes, we need to diversify our trading partners. But for me, this means above all strengthening the domestic market and boosting demand here. I say quite clearly: Trump's customs policy cannot be an excuse for us to throw our standards overboard in new trade agreements and open the door to further outsourcing of industrial production. Despite all the criticism of Trump, we must not forget that there is huge dissatisfaction with globalization in both camps in the USA. And that must not happen in Europe.",

Wann haben Sie das letzte Mal für Ihre Wähler so gekämpft wie Trump für seine amerikanischen? Die Frage ist berechtigt, denn Trumps Reaktion ist nur eine logische Entwicklung der letzten Jahrzehnte. Die Arbeitsplätze, nicht nur aus den USA, auch aus Europa, sind abgewandert in Billiglohnländer. Das haben unsere Menschen, unsere Arbeiter zu spüren bekommen, genauso wie die Amerikaner. Zuerst in der Stahlindustrie, dann in der Elektronikindustrie, in der Automobilindustrie, und jetzt zuletzt sind sogar unsere Bauern dran. Wie ist unsere Reaktion? Wollen wir in einen Handelskrieg eintreten? Wollen wir mit künstlicher Verteuerung der Importe reagieren? Natürlich nicht! Wir brauchen den freien Handel, wir wollen den freien Handel.

Wir haben die besser ausgebildeten Arbeitskräfte, wir haben eine innovative Industrie, wir haben Rohstoffe auf diesem Kontinent, wir können diesen Wettbewerb aufnehmen, aber wir müssen die Fesseln sprengen, die uns hier bremsen. Wir müssen den Green Deal beenden, Steuern runter, und wir müssen das Bürokratiemonster Brüssel zerschlagen. „Afuera“, das ist das Motto der Zeit, und dann kann unser Motto heißen: „Make Europe great again“.",
         "Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. \"Make America great again\" is of course a declaration of war on the whole world, on the EU, on Europe. Why is that? The American President naturally cares about the Americans - oh wonder! He wants jobs in the United States. He wants prosperity back in the United States. He wants to bring industry back to the United States. And what do I hear here? Trump, Trump, Trump! One man is enough to send the European Parliament into an uproar. Dear colleagues, instead of moaning and complaining about Trump, you from the old parties should think about it: What have you done? When was the last time you fought for your voters like Trump did for his American voters? The question is justified, because Trump's reaction is just a logical development of the last few decades. Jobs, not just from the USA, but also from Europe, have migrated to low-wage countries. Our people, our workers, have felt the effects of this, just like the Americans. First in the steel industry, then in the electronics industry, in the automotive industry, and now it's even our farmers' turn. What is our reaction? Do we want to enter into a trade war? Do we want to react by making imports artificially more expensive? Of course not! We need free trade, we want free trade. And Europe - and I don't mean the EU - Europe can take on this competition. We have a better educated workforce, we have an innovative industry, we have raw materials on this continent, we can take on this competition, but we have to break the shackles that are holding us back here. We need to end the Green Deal, lower taxes and we need to smash the Brussels bureaucracy monster. \"Afuera\" is the motto of the time, and then our motto can be: \"Make Europe great again\".",

         "Herr Präsident, sehr geehrte Damen und Herren! US-Präsident Donald Trump versucht, uns mit Strafzöllen zu erpressen. Er will, dass wir mehr von seinem schmutzigen Fracking-Gas kaufen. Und er will den Abstieg der US-Industrie bremsen. Aber wir in Europa, wir sind nur bedingt ökonomisch verteidigungsfähig, denn wir haben zum Beispiel in Deutschland, der größten Volkswirtschaft Europas, seit drei Jahren Rezession. Wir haben uns mit den Sanktionen mehr selbst geschadet, als dass wir damit Putin getroffen hätten. Wir haben Verbrauchssteuern erhöht, die vor allem die Menschen mit kleinem Einkommen treffen. Und währenddessen besorgen sich die USA jetzt die Seltenen Erden aus der Ukraine, während wir als Zahlmeister am Spielfeldrand stehen. Auch die Transformation zum grünen Stahl, die kann nicht gelingen, wenn die Energiepreise weiter so hoch sind. Deswegen müssen wir zu dem Prinzip zurückkehren, zu sagen: Wir besorgen uns die Energie wieder vom billigsten Anbieter. Das wäre die richtige Antwort auf Donald Trump, um uns nicht weiter erpressbar zu machen. Und es würde ein diplomatisches Fenster in der Ukraine öffnen. Wir brauchen mehr öffentliche Investitionen. Es ist doch völlig verrückt, wenn in den Talkshows nun darüber diskutiert wird, wir sollten Panzer statt Volkswagen bauen. Und wir brauchen Strafsteuern auf Finanzflüsse der Big-Tech-Unternehmen, um unseren Mittelstand zu schützen.",
         "Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen! US President Donald Trump is trying to blackmail us with punitive tariffs. He wants us to buy more of his dirty fracking gas. And he wants to slow down the decline of US industry. But we in Europe only have limited economic defenses, because in Germany, for example, Europe's largest economy, we have been in recession for three years. We have done more harm to ourselves with the sanctions than we have done to Putin. We have increased consumption taxes, which primarily affect people with low incomes. And in the meantime, the USA is now procuring rare earths from Ukraine, while we stand on the sidelines as paymasters. Even the transformation to green steel cannot succeed if energy prices remain so high. That's why we need to return to the principle of saying: we'll get our energy from the cheapest supplier again. That would be the right response to Donald Trump, so as not to make ourselves vulnerable to further blackmail. And it would open a diplomatic window in Ukraine. We need more public investment. It's completely crazy when the talk shows are now discussing whether we should build tanks instead of Volkswagens. And we need punitive taxes on the financial flows of big tech companies to protect our SMEs.",

Und wenn wir uns ökonomisch mehr schaden, als dass wir die Fähigkeit Putins, einen Krieg zu führen, beeinträchtigen, dann ist das einfach keine sinnvolle Politik. Wir haben selbstverständlich nach dem Irakkrieg nicht angefangen, die USA zu sanktionieren, weil wir uns damit selbst ins Knie geschossen hätten. Deswegen ist das keine moralische Frage, sondern eine Frage der politischen Logik, dass wir eine Politik machen, die den Menschen in Europa dient. Und wenn sie eben nicht zum gewünschten Ergebnis führt, dann kann ja eine Entspannung der Sanktionen auch ein Instrument sein, um zu einem Waffenstillstand zu gelangen. Deswegen sind jene unmoralisch, die diesen Krieg unnötig verlängern wollen und immer mehr Blut und Leichenberge in Kauf nehmen.",
         "Well, the question of morality depends on which instrument is suitable for ending the war in Ukraine as quickly as possible. And if we harm ourselves economically more than we impair Putin's ability to wage war, then that is simply not a sensible policy. Of course, we didn't start sanctioning the USA after the Iraq war because we would have shot ourselves in the foot. That is why it is not a moral question, but a question of political logic that we pursue a policy that serves the people of Europe. And if it does not lead to the desired result, then relaxing the sanctions can also be an instrument for achieving a ceasefire. That is why those who want to prolong this war unnecessarily and accept more and more blood and piles of corpses are immoral.",

El precio de los productos afectados ha aumentado cerca de un 12 % para los consumidores. De continuar este encarecimiento, provocará una pérdida de 7 300 millones de dólares anuales, algo que ya está notándose en el empleo con la destrucción de 40 000 puestos de trabajo al otro lado del Atlántico. Por tanto, el fracaso de los aranceles es ya manifiesto. De ahí que la suspensión haya sido por fin una medida racional por parte del señor Trump, necesaria tanto para estadounidenses como para europeos. Pero no podemos conformarnos con ella: necesitamos su eliminación definitiva, incluida la tasa del 10 %, que todavía sigue en vigor. No podemos permitir que la amenaza arancelaria penda sobre nuestras cabezas como una espada de Damocles. No podemos seguir poniendo en riesgo la seguridad jurídica de cientos de miles de productores europeos.",

If this price increase continues, it will cause a loss of 7.3 billion dollars a year, something that is already being felt in employment with the destruction of 40,000 jobs on the other side of the Atlantic. The failure of the tariffs is therefore obvious. Hence the suspension was finally a rational measure on the part of Mr. Trump, necessary for both Americans and Europeans. But we cannot be satisfied with it: we need its definitive elimination, including the 10% tariff, which is still in force. We cannot allow the tariff threat to hang over our heads like a sword of Damocles. We cannot continue to jeopardize the legal security of hundreds of thousands of European producers.",

Stajemy dziś w obliczu kolejnej próby dla Unii Europejskiej, czyli odpowiedzi na jednostronne decyzje w polityce handlowej Stanów Zjednoczonych, które uderzają w interesy europejskich przedsiębiorstw. Współpraca transatlantycka jest dla nas ważna, ale musi być oparta na partnerstwie, a nie uległości. Przez lata Europa straciła swoją konkurencyjność. Gospodarka Unii rozwija się znacznie wolniej niż gospodarka amerykańska czy azjatycka. Unijne regulacje dławią innowacje. Polityka klimatyczna zwiększa koszty produkcji, a biurokracja zniechęca inwestorów. W takich warunkach nie możemy mówić o suwerenności gospodarczej. Odpowiedzią nie może być więcej regulacji ani kolejne zielone transformacje, które przynoszą wyższe rachunki, a nie realne miejsca pracy. Musimy odbudować europejski przemysł, chronić nasz rynek i żądać równych zasad gry w relacjach z każdym partnerem, również ze Stanami Zjednoczonymi. Nie chodzi o konfrontację, ale o podmiotowość. Europa musi przestać być laboratorium ideologii, a zacząć być realną siłą gospodarczą. Żeby to zrobić, trzeba zerwać z polityką prowadzoną od lat przez lewicowo-liberalną większość. Polityka handlowa Unii nie może być prowadzona na niemieckie zamówienie. Dlatego umowa o wolnym handlu Unia Europejska – Mercosur nadaje się tylko do kosza, bo likwiduje bezpieczeństwo żywnościowe Europy. Trzeba zapobiec wojnie handlowej.

Today we are faced with another test for the European Union, that of responding to unilateral decisions in US trade policy that hit the interests of European businesses. Transatlantic cooperation is important to us, but it must be based on partnership, not submission. Over the years, Europe has lost its competitiveness. The EU economy is growing much slower than the US or Asian economies. EU regulations stifle innovation. Climate policy increases production costs, and bureaucracy discourages investors. Under such conditions, we cannot speak of economic sovereignty. The answer cannot be more regulations or more green transformations that bring higher bills, not real jobs. We must rebuild European industry, protect our market and demand a level playing field with every partner, including the United States. This is not about confrontation, but about subjectivity. Europe must stop being a laboratory of ideology and start being a real economic force. To do so, it needs to break with the policies pursued for years by the left-liberal majority. The Union's trade policy cannot be conducted on German orders. That's why the European Union-Mercosur free trade agreement is only fit for the trash, because it removes Europe's food security. A trade war must be prevented. We must repair relations with the United States, because it is still Europe's greatest ally and NATO partner.",

L'Europe doit assurer son autonomie stratégique, répondre de manière ferme et unie à toute hausse des tarifs sans transiger sur ses législations et en utilisant les recettes de la hausse des tarifs, ainsi que celles d'une taxe digitale pour soutenir les travailleurs et les entreprises européennes qui sont touchés. Nous devons contrer les arrivées de marchandises destinées au marché américain, mais que l'imposition des tarifs aurait détournées, notamment vers l'Union européenne. Oui, nous devons renforcer nos partenariats avec les autres pays frappés par la guerre commerciale de Trump, mais des partenariats équitables qui ont pour point de départ et pour point d'arrivée les objectifs de développement durable. Il n'est pas question de transiger avec nos droits sociaux et environnementaux ni avec les droits humains. Il n'est donc pas question non plus de se précipiter dans des accords avec la Chine, l'Inde, le Mercosur, qui risqueraient de rendre l'Union européenne encore plus dépendante et vulnérable.

Europe must ensure its strategic autonomy, responding firmly and unitedly to any tariff hikes without compromising on its legislation, and using the revenues from tariff hikes, as well as those from a digital tax, to support European workers and businesses who are affected. We must counter the influx of goods destined for the US market, but which the imposition of tariffs would have diverted, notably to the European Union. Yes, we must strengthen our partnerships with the other countries hit by Trump's trade war, but fair partnerships that have the Sustainable Development Goals as their starting point and end point. There is no question of compromising our social and environmental rights or human rights. Nor is there any question of rushing into agreements with China, India or Mercosur, which would risk making the European Union even more dependent and vulnerable. Strengthening our strategic economy means investing without delay in our energy independence, our food autonomy, the circular economy, the reduction of our dependence on resources, our industrial redeployment - in a word, the transition to true European autonomy.",

When it comes to economic incentives, the numbers in trade volumes between the EU and the US speak for themselves. Just last year, US-EU goods trade hit a record of USD 976 billion. But that trust – trust in rules, commitments, in partners is shaken on both sides of the Atlantic. Economic nationalism does not make you first, but it makes you alone. And this is not leadership – this is volatility masquerading as strength. When we speak about strength, the numbers are clear, and Europe can respond with resolve.

Da qui dobbiamo mandare un messaggio chiaro: le nostre leggi le decidiamo in Europa per gli europei. Nei prossimi mesi negozieremo per superare questa situazione dannosa per l'economia di entrambe le sponde dell'Atlantico. Con la commissione Commercio saremo a Washington a fine mese. Vogliamo trovare un accordo utile: ma se non ci sarà davvero la volontà di arrivarci, saremo pronti a rispondere con contromisure forti su beni e servizi americani. In ogni caso, l'Europa deve stabilire un'alleanza con tutti coloro che vogliono mantenere un ordine del commercio mondiale fondato sulle regole e stipulare nuovi accordi. Questa che stiamo vivendo è l'ennesima prova: in questo mondo così complicato c'è bisogno di un'Unione europea più unita e più forte.",
         "Mr. President, Mr. Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, the real goal of the illegal tariffs imposed by Donald Trump is one and only one: to disrupt the European democratic and social model by tearing down our norms that protect us on what we eat and drink, what environment we live in, what rights we have in the face of technological giants. From here we must send a clear message: we decide our laws in Europe for Europeans. In the coming months we will negotiate to overcome this harmful situation for the economy on both sides of the Atlantic. With the Trade Commission we will be in Washington at the end of the month. We want to find a useful agreement: but if there is really no will to get there, we will be ready to respond with strong countermeasures on American goods and services. In any case, Europe must establish an alliance with all those who want to maintain a rules-based world trade order and make new agreements. This we are experiencing is yet another proof: in this complicated world, there is a need for a more united and stronger European Union.",

Biztos, hogy nem egy kereskedelmi háború! Azzal a saját polgárainknak, vállalatainknak és iparunknak ártanánk a legtöbbet. Sérülnének az ellátó láncok, áremelkedés történne, vállalatokat veszítenénk. Súlyos stratégiai hiba volt, hogy a választások előtt a brüsszeli mainstream egyértelműen letette a voksát a demokrata jelölt mellett. A korrigálás túl későn érkezett. Le kellene végre szokni arról, hogy Brüsszelből próbálják megmondani, egyes országok polgárai milyen kormányra szavazzanak. A Bizottságtól azt várjuk el, hogy hatékony tárgyalással rendezze a kialakult helyzetet. Legyen nyitott az innovatív megoldásokra. Üzletemberrel üzletember módjára kell tárgyalni, közben rendet kell tenni a saját portánkon. Le kell végre építeni a bürokráciát, kevesebb és egyszerűbb szabály kell, véget kell vetni az előző öt év ideológiai, gazdasági és kereskedelmi politikájának, meg kell védeni a gazdákat, és vonzóbbá kell tenni a belső piacot. Így maradhat Európa nyitott mindenki felé a kölcsönös haszon reményében. Csak így nyerhetjük vissza a versenyképességünket, és lehetünk újra komoly szereplői a nemzetközi történéseknek.",
         "Mr President! In these turbulent times, we need strategic calm, no rushing, no threats. We need to think about what is in Europe's interest. Certainly not a trade war! That would do our own citizens, our own companies and our own industry the most harm. Supply chains would be damaged, prices would rise, companies would be lost. It was a serious strategic error that the Brussels mainstream clearly voted for the Democratic candidate before the elections. The correction came too late. We should finally stop trying to tell people in Brussels which government to vote for in each country. We expect the Commission to resolve the situation through effective negotiation. Be open to innovative solutions. Negotiate with business like a businessman, while tidying up our own mess. We need to cut red tape at long last, we need fewer and simpler rules, we need to put an end to the ideological, economic and trade policy of the last five years, we need to protect farmers and we need to make the internal market more attractive. That is how Europe can remain open to all in the hope of mutual benefit. Only in this way can we regain our competitiveness and become a serious player on the international scene.",

Ei, me ei peakski Trumpi karistama selle eest, vaid peaksime mõtlema, et kuidas arendada omaenda majandust. Euroopa Liidu praegune majandusruum on direktiivide ja regulatsioonide labürint. See lämmatab ettevõtlikkust, tõrjub investeeringuid ja pidurdab majanduskasvu. Euroopa oli kunagi vabaturumajanduse eestkõneleja, aga on liikumas sotsialistliku käsumajanduse suunas. Ettevõtjad kulutavad praegu rohkem aega regulatiivsete nõuete täitmisele kui toote arendustele. Paljud firmad loobuvad laienemisest, sest ei suuda kanda direktiividest tulenevaid kulusid. Investorid eelistavad oma raha paigutada riikidesse, kus riskid on väiksemad ja regulatsioonid mõistlikumad. Me ei tohi lubada, et bürokraatia asendab vaba ettevõtluse vaimu. Just vabadus on ajalooliselt viinud Euroopa suuremate innovatsioonideni, loonud töökohti ja jõukust. Euroopal on potentsiaal olla juhtiv jõud maailma majanduses, kui ta taastab usu turu vabadusse. See tähendab usaldust ettevõtjate vastu. See tähendab lihtsamaid ja paindlikumaid reegleid. See tähendab vähem direktiive ja rohkem otsustusvabadust. Muu hulgas tähendab see muidugi ka rohepöördele vee peale tõmbamist. Ainult nii kaitseme Euroopa majandushuve ja oma kodanike heaolu.",
         "Dear President. Yes, thank you very much, dear colleagues! And how should the European Union respond to the US tariffs that they have imposed? No, we should not punish Trump for this, but we should think about how to develop our own economy. The European Union's current economic space is a labyrinth of directives and regulations. It stifles entrepreneurship, discourages investment and stifles growth. Europe used to be a champion of the free market economy, but it is moving towards a socialist command economy. Businesses now spend more time on regulatory compliance than on product development. Many companies are abandoning expansion because they cannot bear the costs of directives. Investors prefer to put their money in countries where the risks are lower and the regulations more reasonable. We must not allow red tape to replace the spirit of free enterprise. It is freedom that has historically led Europe to greater innovation, jobs and prosperity. Europe has the potential to be a leading force in the global economy if it restores faith in market freedom. That means trust in entrepreneurs. It means simpler and more flexible rules. It means fewer directives and more freedom of choice. Among other things, of course, it also means putting the green revolution on the back burner. This is the only way to protect Europe's economic interests and the well-being of its citizens.",

Environmental dumping is becoming a major competitive advantage, and some political leaders are no longer reliable. Faced with this drift, we need to rethink our trade agreements to make them more balanced, while protecting our vital interests and values, and ensuring our strategic autonomy. International trade cannot be reduced to quotas, volumes and prices. It must regain meaning, based on the theory of comparative advantage.

Nel 2023 gli Stati Uniti hanno importato dall'Unione europea beni per circa 157 miliardi di euro. Però dobbiamo allargare lo sguardo ai servizi e qui notiamo che sono gli Stati Uniti ad avere un surplus di 109 miliardi. Questo ci ricorda di quanto le relazioni economiche siano complesse e vadano lette nel loro insieme. Oggi i dazi sono sospesi ma le tensioni restano e intanto molte grandi aziende statunitensi, in particolare nel digitale, continuano a fare profitti esorbitanti. È una questione di giustizia: dobbiamo mettere riparo a questa situazione. Per questo serve una tassa sui servizi digitali. Inoltre l'Unione europea dovrebbe allargare i suoi legami commerciali con altri paesi emergenti, i BRICS, e non dipendere dalle scelte unilaterali di Trump. Non dimentichiamoci le ricadute economiche dei dazi, la recessione. Per questo dobbiamo puntare anche sulla crescita dei salari, sulla domanda interna e sui consumi. L'Europa deve vincere le sfide con maggiore forza nei confronti del potente di turno a Washington.",

This reminds us of how complex economic relations are and must be read as a whole. Today the tariffs are suspended but tensions remain and meanwhile many large U.S. companies, particularly in digital, continue to make exorbitant profits. This is a matter of justice: we need to remedy this situation. That's why we need a tax on digital services. In addition, the European Union should expand its trade ties with other emerging countries, the BRICS, and not depend on Trump's unilateral choices. Let's not forget the economic fallout of tariffs, recession. So we must also focus on wage growth, domestic demand and consumption.

You have also self-imposed duties when you have enacted short-sighted ideological policies such as the Green Deal, the stop to endothermic engines that are only leading Europe to productive desertification and unemployment, depriving families of their purchasing power. So instead of pointing fingers at those leaders who choose to do their country's best interest, take an example and cancel all those impositions that are leading Europe to industrial and geopolitical suicide.

But we must do so without compromising our standards: food, safety, security, etc. Targeted coordination on critical sectors and technologies is what we should be locking in on. That includes improving customs processing, eliminating red tape, and other measures that slow innovation on both sides of the Atlantic.

We need permanent EU trade representation not just in Washington but in the wider US, to identify, negotiate and remove the barriers that still hold back transatlantic trade. But we must do so without compromising our standards: food, safety, security, etc. Targeted coordination on critical sectors and technologies is what we should be locking in on. That includes improving customs processing, eliminating red tape, and other measures that slow innovation on both sides of the Atlantic. And while I rarely quote Elon Musk, I'll agree with him on this: Europe and the US should aim for a 'zero-tariff zone'. So a stronger, freer trade relationship – rooted in trust and common democratic ground – is in both of our interests.",

         "Vážený pán predsedajúci, Trump Američanom odkázal, že na Vianoce bude menej hračiek a budú drahšie. To sú skvelé výsledky politiky ciel Donalda Trumpa. Politikov, čo mu fandia, ale máme aj v Európe a aj na Slovensku na čele s predsedom vlády Róbertom Ficom. Naši občania pritom budú trpieť najviac: v automobilkách, oceliarniach, v subdodávkach. Vláda sa má za naše firmy biť aj za našich občanov, a to spolu s Úniou. Nestačí zamestnancov poslať na kurzarbeit. A nepomôže ani cesta premiéra do Moskvy tento týždeň. Je dobré, že v Kanade aj v Austrálii vyhrali politici, ktorí veria vo férový obchod a nie v šikanu. Máme otvárať trhy, máme zlepšovať podnikateľské prostredie, máme lákať firmy a talenty do Európy. Ale áno, treba aj rokovať a trpezlivo rokovať so Spojenými štátmi. Ale aj my chceme spravodlivosť v obchode. Obrovskí digitálni obri a giganty v Európe zarábajú miliardy eur. Je to fér? Ak sa nedohodneme so Spojenými štátmi, Komisia musí konať a my budeme jej partnermi.",
         "Mr President, Mr Trump has told the American people that there will be fewer toys and they will be more expensive at Christmas. These are the great results of Donald Trump's tariffs policy. However, we also have politicians cheering him on in Europe and also in Slovakia, led by Prime Minister Róbert Fico. Our citizens will suffer the most: in the car factories, in the steel mills, in subcontracting. The government is supposed to fight for our companies and our citizens, together with the Union. It is not enough to send employees to coursework. Nor will the Prime Minister's trip to Moscow this week help. It is good that in both Canada and Australia, politicians who believe in fair trade and not bullying have won. We are supposed to open markets, we are supposed to improve the business environment, we are supposed to attract companies and talent to Europe. But, yes, we also need to negotiate and negotiate patiently with the United States. But we also want fairness in trade. The huge digital giants and giants in Europe are making billions of euros. Is that fair? If we do not reach an agreement with the United States, the Commission must act and we will be its partners.",

         "Señor presidente, señor comisario, las políticas arancelarias de Trump no son una guerra comercial. Son, sobre todo, un ataque a nuestros valores y a nuestra democracia. Es una lucha entre la oligarquía y los demócratas. Lo hemos visto en dos episodios recientemente. Primero, se ha hecho patente con el rechazo a la propuesta del comisario de generar un espacio de cero aranceles entre Europa y Estados Unidos, así como con el rechazo a la visita del ministro español de Economía, que terminó con una crítica directa a los impuestos que tenemos en la Unión Europea, una crítica directa a nuestra protección social, medioambiental y laboral. Por eso le pedimos, señor comisario, que no ceda al chantaje, que refuerce a nuestros trabajadores y trabajadoras y nuestra economía, que refuerce nuestra legislación medioambiental y ―sobre todo― que deje de pactar con el caballo de Troya de la Administración Trump aquí en Europa, que es la extrema derecha que nos quiere más débiles y más divididos. Por ello, le decimos alto y claro que no ceda al chantaje y que nuestros valores y nuestra democracia no están en venta.",
         "Mr. Chairman, Commissioner, Trump's tariff policies are not a trade war. They are, above all, an attack on our values and our democracy. It is a fight between the oligarchy and the Democrats. We have seen this in two episodes recently. First, it has been made clear with the rejection of the Commissioner's proposal to generate a zero-tariff space between Europe and the United States, as well as with the rejection of the visit of the Spanish Minister of Economy, which ended with a direct criticism of the taxes we have in the European Union, a direct criticism of our social, environmental and labor protection. That is why we ask you, Commissioner, not to give in to blackmail, to strengthen our workers and our economy, to strengthen our environmental legislation and -above all- to stop making pacts with the Trojan horse of the Trump Administration here in Europe, which is the extreme right that wants us weaker and more divided. Therefore, we tell him loud and clear that he should not give in to blackmail and that our values and our democracy are not for sale.",

While it is clear that European workers will only lose in a full-fledged trade war, the EU should be much bolder and much more imaginative in its own response to Trump's actions. The EU should target the oligarchs that are close to Trump, through action directed at Tesla and Musk, and by digital tax aimed at the huge digital platforms. The EU should also signal its readiness to use the Anti-Coercion Instrument. But most importantly, we need to make the European economy less dependent on US exports. That means supporting internal demand in the European markets, and that means supporting real wage growth and also increasing investments. More than ever, we need to put people and workers first in our economic policymaking.",

         "Herr Präsident, Herr Vizepräsident, Herr Minister, liebe Kolleginnen, liebe Kollegen! US‑Zölle treffen unsere Unternehmen ins Mark. Die Vereinigten Staaten sind unser wichtigster Handelspartner, und viele Arbeitsplätze hängen hier in der Europäischen Union am Export. Wenn die US‑Administration einseitig unberechtigt Zölle verhängt und uns damit letztlich den Zollkrieg erklärt, müssen wir entschlossen und vor allen Dingen gemeinsam handeln. Ich finde, dass die Kommission richtig reagiert hat – besonnen: Sie haben nicht sofort Gegenzölle verhängt, Sie waren immer zum Dialog bereit, für Verhandlungen offen, haben hart verhandelt. Aber die Kommission hat sich auch vorbereitet, Gegenmaßnahmen zu verhängen, sofort zu reagieren, falls die Zölle scharf gestellt werden. Ich denke, es ist wichtig, daneben auch neue strategische Partner zu finden. Auch da muss ich der Kommission ein Kompliment aussprechen. Sie sind in der ganzen Welt unterwegs: Mercosur‑Abkommen ist abgeschlossen worden, mit Indien wird verhandelt, mit den ASEAN‑Staaten, mit afrikanischen Ländern. Ich begrüße alle diese Initiativen – das ist genau der richtige Weg – und bedanke mich und wünsche, dass Sie so weitermachen und erfolgreich auch weitere Handelsabkommen abschließen können.",
         "Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Mr. Minister, ladies and gentlemen! US tariffs hit our companies to the core. The United States is our most important trading partner and many jobs here in the European Union depend on exports. If the US administration unilaterally imposes unjustified tariffs and ultimately declares a tariff war on us, we must act decisively and, above all, together. I think that the Commission has reacted correctly - prudently: You did not immediately impose counter-tariffs, you were always ready for dialog, open to negotiations, negotiated hard. But the Commission has also prepared itself to impose countermeasures, to react immediately if the tariffs are imposed. I think it is also important to find new strategic partners. Here, too, I must compliment the Commission. You are on the move all over the world: the Mercosur agreement has been concluded, negotiations are underway with India, with the ASEAN states and with African countries. I welcome all these initiatives - this is exactly the right way to go - and I thank you and hope that you can continue in this vein and successfully conclude further trade agreements.",
